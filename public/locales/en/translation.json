      "l3": "<b>Philosophical Contributions:</b> His work focuses on understanding existence as coexistence, the conscious self, humane conduct, and establishing a humane social order via value education for consciousness development in Humankind.

      "p1": "The third amongst five siblings, Shri Agrahar Nagraj Sarman was born on 14th January 1920 in the village of Agrahar, near Ramnathpura, Hassan Dist, Karnataka. The family belonged to the ‘sanketi’ community, and was revered at that time for their scholarship, service (seva) and hard work. They were ‘ved murtis’ or masters of the vedas.",
      "p2": "Since the age of 5 of itself, young Nagraj had questions regarding the respect that the others in the village bestowed on his family. On questioning, he was informed that his family had produced scholars since many generations, hence the respect.",
      "p3": "Nagraj did not show any interest in the scriptural studies in his family tradition (vedas). He did not receive any formal schooling. His family was quite upset with his cross questioning and lack of scholarship."
    },
    "section4": {
      "h1": "Questioning Period",
      "p1": "During his late teens, Nagraj started studying the scriptures in order to understand them and escape being called a fool by his relatives.",
      "p2": " On doing so, he felt there were major inconsistencies in the scriptures that his family held in utmost esteem (advaita moksha interpretation, of the vedanta). How could the world that has arisen of the ultimate truth brahman be mithya or false? Why is there is a difference in what his elders said and how they were? While India was to gain Independence soon, what is the definition of National Character? This was in 1946. Pained by these questions he visited many learned men of the time, including sri ramana maharishi and sri chandrashekhar bharati of sringeri amongst others.",
      "p3": "They told him the only way to get answers was to see the state of Samadhi. Based on their assurance, he decided to attempt the penultimate stage in Indian Vedic thought - Samadhi, in which the ‘unknown is said to become known’."
    },
    "section5": {
      "h1": "Sadhana - Spiritual Practice",
      "p1": "He arrived in the then remote, dense, tiger infested forests of Amarkantak with his wife in 1949 - he was 30 years old then.",
      "p2": " He performed rigorous sadhana (meditative practice) between 1949 and 1968 using the Agama tantra upasana method. He went on to realize/experience samadhi after 18 years of rigorous practice, 12 hours a day. When his basic question was unanswered even after attaining the final Samadhi in 1968, he went on to perform an advanced stage called sanyam using a self improvised method. As a result, he was a direct witness to the ultimate reality & truth - he had realization of the fundamental nature, origins and purpose of life and the universe, of the human being and human purpose. All his questions were answered, and more."

      "h1": "In his own words..",
      "p1": "Prior to Existence based human centric contemplation, I (Agrahar Nagraj, village: Agrahar, District: Hassan, State: Karnataka, India) was initiated in the practice of worship in accordance with “Spiritual knowledge- Vedic thought”. In order to quench my curiosity, I accepted the completion of the task of ‘sadhana’*, ‘samadhi’* and ‘sanyam’*. Consequently, during the period of ‘sadhana’, in the state of ‘sanyam,’ I attained understanding through ‘Realization’ of ‘existence itself being and operating as co-existence’ and subsequently presented ‘Madhyasth Darshan- Sah Astitvavaad’ as a new philosophy.",
      "p2": " I understood that ‘human tradition aligned with awakening’ and ‘human order aligned with humanity and participating in the whole order’ itself is eternal magnificence. I accepted this as ‘universal good’ and recognized the presence of the expectation of ‘goodness’ in every human. I consequently presented consciousness development based value education, humane conduct, human organization, and constitution to entire humanity.”"

Many of us took to this Study seriously, recognizing it resolved all human questions. These efforts slowly took the shape of a program to disseminate this understanding among people and to bring it in school & higher education.",
      "p2": "Sri Nagraj established the ‘Jeevan Vidya program’ without any established structure, or hierarchies. There is no give and take of money. The only concern for those involved is gyan, knowledge baba-nagraj-2 and the Universal Good. All his efforts were to establish this understanding in others – just as a seed replicates itself; so the vision of an Undivided Human Society and Universal Order can be evidenced on this planet.",

He published the Madhyasth Darshan canon from his own earnings.",

      "Omnipotence (space) is Mediating (madhyasth*), it is all-pervasive. Nature in Omnipotence is as attractive, repulsive, and mediating (madhyasth) activities and is limited. Therefore Omnipotence is in the complete(perfect)-state.",
      "Material and conscious nature in Omnipotence (space) is continuously-evolving therefore nature is contained in the Omnipotence (space). Therefore, Nature is totally inundated in the Omnipotence (space). As nature is saturated in the Omnipotence (space), therefore, nature is fully-energized. In other words nature is continuously-evolving. Therefore, nature continuously manifests effort, motion, and constitution. As a result, nature itself is perceivable in four natural-orders. For this reason, out of the physio-chemical and conscious nature saturated in Omnipotence, the opportunities for conscious nature for attaining the potential, ability, and receptivity for realization are always close, and the four natural-orders are completely bound amongst each other for wholeness.",
      "Omnipotence (space) is Mediating (madhyasth). Therefore, nature saturated in Mediating (madhyasth) Omnipotence is restrained and protected. The central-part (nucleus) found in every atom is the Mediating (madhyasth)-activity. Therefore, attractive and repulsive activities and relative forces (in every atom) are restrained and protected.",
      "Infinite activities or groups of activities itself is nature, which is recognizable as physiochemical (jad) and conscious (chaitanya). Physiochemical nature itself attains the conscious-plane after development-completeness. This is by way of existential destiny. Human-being is a combined form of physiochemical and conscious, and at the same time is also a part of nature.",
      "In (the process of) development-progression, constitutional-completeness itself is development, while (in the process of) awakening-progression, awakening in deluded human-beings itself is functional-completeness and conduct-completeness. The Awakened human-being nourishes purposefulness and right-use by way of behavior and occupation with less-developed nature. Human-being has the responsibility for behavior with other humans, glory with those more awakened, and practices, studies and contemplates for higher awakening.",
      "Only a human-being in delusion is free at the time of performing actions but subservient at the time of receiving the results.",
      "Human-beings on this Earth are in awakening-progression. The opportunity, expectation, and possibility for becoming awakened is available to them. The primary trait of an awakened human-being is his being helpful for less-evolved ones.",
      "Respirating-order (pranic-order) is more evolved than material-order, animal-order is more evolved than respirating-order (pranic) and servile-human (pashu-manav) of knowledge-order in illusion is more evolved than animal-order. Beastial-human (rakshas-manav) of knowledge-order in illusion is more evolved than the servile-human in illusion, Human with discernment (bhrant-abhrant) is more evolved than the beastial-human, and godly-human (dev-manav) in non-illusion is more evolved than the human with discernment. Divine Human (Divya-manav) with complete-awakening is more evolved than godly-human with non-illusion.",
      "Units of knowledge-order are endowed with the capacity for realistic-view (darshan). Realistic-view (darshan) is in the sense of physiochemical and conscious nature situated in all-pervasive entity or Omnipresence.",
      "It is only in the non-delusion state that realization-knowledge and realistic-view (darshan) get completed. Which is why –",
