    "content": "Home\nAbout\nAbout A Nagraj\nAbout\nWhat is Madhyasth Darshan\nAuthors Testimony\nVision for the World\nImpact in Education & Society\nAbout A. Nagraj\nContact Us\nIn Brief\n\nShri A Nagraj produced Madhyasth Darshan, also known as Jeevan Vidya, through his extensive realizations\n\nEarly Life: Born on January 14, 1920, in Agrahar, Karnataka, India, A. Nagraj was deeply curious about the inconsistencies he observed in traditional scriptures and teachings.\nSpiritual Journey: He embarked on a rigorous meditative practice in the forests of Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh, from 1950 to 1968. Through this, he attained a state of realization and developed the principles of Madhyasth Darshan based on what he ‘saw’.\nPhilosophical Contributions: His work focuses on understanding existence as coexistence, the conscious self, humane conduct, and establishing a humane social order via value education for consciousness development in Humankind. Shri Nagraj has provided us with a vast body of literature covering fundamental human topics.\n\nA. Nagraj’s contributions have provided a new perspective on human existence and consciousness, emphasizing harmony and coexistence.\n\nDetailed\nEarly Life\n\nThe third amongst five siblings, Shri Agrahar Nagraj Sarman was born on 14th January 1920 in the village of Agrahar, near Ramnathpura, Hassan Dist, Karnataka. The family belonged to the ‘sanketi’ community, and was revered at that time for their scholarship, service (seva) and hard work. They were ‘ved murtis’ or masters of the vedas.\n\nSince the age of 5 of itself, young Nagraj had questions regarding the respect that the others in the village bestowed on his family. On questioning, he was informed that his family had produced scholars since many generations, hence the respect.\n\nNagraj did not show any interest in the scriptural studies in his family tradition (vedas). He did not receive any formal schooling. His family was quite upset with his cross questioning and lack of scholarship.\n\nQuestioning Period\n\nDuring his late teens, Nagraj started studying the scriptures in order to understand them and escape being called a fool by his relatives.\n\nOn doing so, he felt there were major inconsistencies in the scriptures that his family held in utmost esteem (advaita moksha interpretation, of the vedanta). How could the world that has arisen of the ultimate truth brahman be mithya or false? Why is there is a difference in what his elders said and how they were? While India was to gain Independence soon, what is the definition of National Character? This was in 1946. Pained by these questions he visited many learned men of the time, including sri ramana maharishi and sri chandrashekhar bharati of sringeri amongst others.\n\nThey told him the only way to get answers was to see the state of Samadhi. Based on their assurance, he decided to attempt the penultimate stage in Indian Vedic thought - Samadhi, in which the ‘unknown is said to become known’.\n\nSadhana - Spiritual Practice\n\nHe arrived in the then remote, dense, tiger infested forests of Amarkantak with his wife in 1949 - he was 30 years old then.\n\nHe performed rigorous sadhana (meditative practice) between 1949 and 1968 using the Agama tantra upasana method. He went on to realize/experience samadhi after 18 years of rigorous practice, 12 hours a day. When his basic question was unanswered even after attaining the final Samadhi in 1968, he went on to perform an advanced stage called sanyam using a self improvised method. As a result, he was a direct witness to the ultimate reality & truth - he had realization of the fundamental nature, origins and purpose of life and the universe, of the human being and human purpose. All his questions were answered, and more.\n\nIn his own words..\n\nPrior to Existence based human centric contemplation, I (Agrahar Nagraj, village: Agrahar, District: Hassan, State: Karnataka, India) was initiated in the practice of worship in accordance with “Spiritual knowledge- Vedic thought”. In order to quench my curiosity, I accepted the completion of the task of ‘sadhana’*, ‘samadhi’* and ‘sanyam’*. Consequently, during the period of ‘sadhana’, in the state of ‘sanyam,’ I attained understanding through ‘Realization’ of ‘existence itself being and operating as co-existence’ and subsequently presented ‘Madhyasth Darshan- Sah Astitvavaad’ as a new philosophy.\n\nI understood that ‘human tradition aligned with awakening’ and ‘human order aligned with humanity and participating in the whole order’ itself is eternal magnificence. I accepted this as ‘universal good’ and recognized the presence of the expectation of ‘goodness’ in every human. I consequently presented consciousness development based value education, humane conduct, human organization, and constitution to entire humanity.”\n\nMadhyasth Darshan - a new perspective to Human Knowledge\n\nAccepting that what he had ‘discovered’ belonged to the entire human race, superseding religion, race & belief, he started writing it in literature form from 1975 to 2005 – by when it assumed the form of the madhyasth darshan literature. He has presented this as an Alternative to Materialism & Idealism (Spiritualism, Theism, etc). This work does not promote or refer to any other philosophy/ darsana / body of knowledge.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan is able to solve deep unsolved questions regarding human existence.\n\nThe Jeevan Vidya Program\n\nSince 1980, many ordinary & eminent people, many humans, came in touch with Sri Nagraj and spent substantial amounts of time trying to learn what he had understood. Many of us took to this Study seriously, recognizing it resolved all human questions. These efforts slowly took the shape of a program to disseminate this understanding among people and to bring it in school & higher education.\n\nSri Nagraj established the ‘Jeevan Vidya program’ without any established structure, or hierarchies. There is no give and take of money. The only concern for those involved is gyan, knowledge baba-nagraj-2 and the Universal Good. All his efforts were to establish this understanding in others – just as a seed replicates itself; so the vision of an Undivided Human Society and Universal Order can be evidenced on this planet.\n\n~\n\nThey Study and Practice of Madhyasth Darshan is in\norder to understand Existence – all that exists;\nknow ones Self, and know Human Living.\n\n~\n\nEpilogue\n\nShri Nagraj lived in Amarkantak from 1950 to 2016 with his wife, children and grand children. An accomplished Ayurvedic medicine practitioner, he didn't take any financial assistance from anyone. He supported his family and those of many others via agriculture, dairy and medicine. He published the Madhyasth Darshan canon from his own earnings.\n\nShri Nagraj spent the first 30 years of his life in Karnataka and the latter 66 years in Amarkantak, MP. He passed away on 05 March 2016 having lived the life of a human, having known what it is to be human, having taught what it is to be human.\n\nTerms\n\n* sadhana-samadhi-sanyam:\n‘sadhana’ – taming the mind, intense mental practice.\n‘samadhi’ – penultimate state of meditation according to Indian Vedic thought in which the ‘unknown’ is said to become ‘known’.\n‘sanyam’ – a state of knowing beyond samadhi.\nRead More\nRead the official Biography here (Hindi)\nTo get a glimpse into his persona, read recollections - साक्ष्य - संस्मरण - by students (hindi)\nSee A.Nagraj-ji's photos (pics)"

Nagraj\nContact Us\nExistence-based Human-Centric Thinking\n\nThe study related to the knowledge of the conscious ‘jeevan’ was obtained via the method of ‘existence-based human-centered contemplation’. Such attainment was received by A.Nagraj, a resident of Bhajnashram, Amarkantak (MP, India).\n\nI, Nagraj, hereby testify that I have understood ‘existence-based human-centered contemplation’ through sadhana, samadhi and sanyama (method of meditation). I did sadhana (perseverance) on this basis. The (Vedantic) scriptures state that the world is born from (pervasive) Brahman and that ‘Brahman‘ is true (satya), while the world is ‘false’ (mithya). I undertook sadhana driven by this enquiry.\n\n(However) When I studied entire existence in the state of ‘sanyam’, it was revealed that nothing is born from Brahman. Entire nature is working in (pervasive) Brahman.\n\nAccording to materialist tradition, consciousness is an outcome of material processes. Whereas Ishwara-God centric thought says matter is born from consciousness. It has been discovered that this imagination of ‘genesis’ itself is wrong. It has been found that ‘Coexistence’ (of matter, conscious and consciousness) is always present, and this is the ultimate truth.\n\nI identified and understood the following three aspects as having been missing from the ‘idealistic’ and ‘materialistic’ approaches of the past:\n\nKnowledge of existence in the form of co-existence,\nKnowledge of the conscious entity ‘jeevan’, &\nKnowledge of humane conduct.\n\nEvery community to date has had some ideas about the aspect of ‘humane conduct’. When assessed at the end of twentieth century, it is seen that the conduct of a particular community is not acceptable to all human beings. (is not universal).\n\n‘Existence based human-centric thinking’ became cognizable to human beings in the first decade of the twenty first century. Some scholars, scientists and lay people have begun accepting it. This made my mind accept that this is suitable for all human beings.\n\nIt is on this basis that I have tried to present it before humankind. I hope this benefits everyone.\n\n– A. Nagraj, 2009"

The objective of education is to make every child capable of living with coherence in all dimensions, be it realization, thought process, behaviour or occupation and at all levels i.e. individual, family, society, nation and inter-nation.\n\nThe responsibility to make the study successful lies with teachers, parents, education-content and education-procedure because these four are complementary. When teachers, parents and education system are in congruence only then it becomes possible to develop successful teaching methodologies by which the path of gratitude and co-existence gets paved.\n\nEvery human being wants to live with harmony from within and outside. This, in our belief, can only be achieved if the child becomes proficient in knowledge, skill and behaviour as it leads to orderliness in one’s living.\n\nIt’s a step-by-step procedure which begins with identifying each and every relation and addressing them correctly, then identifying the values inherent in each relation for mutual fulfillment.\n\nWhether we are learning different languages, mathematics, science, social science or any other subject, the goal of every human being is to live with resolution, prosperity, fearlessness and co-existence.\n\nEducation related resources (textbooks, guidelines, etc)"

While this ensures physical comfort, it is both unsatisfying to us as Humans as well as detrimental to nature.\n\nFundamental aspects like understanding of the Self, understanding the nature & purpose of human relationships, living in family & society, and our relationship with nature are completely ignored, or at best addressed in a half hearted manner in prevalent education.\n\nThis course aims to reduce that gap and point both students and teachers in the right direction by providing them with the relevant content needed.\n\nThis 'alternative view' of study and life can be provided to students so they may appreciate the need for living with human values and human-consciousness and make efforts to study & practice the same.\n\nOutline of 3 year Program in Human Values (UHVCD):\nNeed for the course:\nSupplement the current education with crucial inputs in Universal Human Values and Ethics that is much needed to ensure all round development in students\nCourse Objectives:\nEnable a holistic & inter-connected view of Life and Living in Students.\nTo help students understand the meaning of happiness, peace and prosperity for a human being\nTo facilitate students in applying the understanding of harmony in existence in their lives and lead an ethical life\nInstill critical thinking and reasoning abilities in the students between 'Right' and 'Wrong'; 'Desirable' & 'Undesirable', etc\nEnable inculcation of:\nUniversal Human Values such as: Trust, Respect, Affection, Kindness, etc\nSocial Character: Rightful Livelihood; Kindness in Work and Behavior, etc\nEthics: Right utilization of ones body, mind & wealth.\nEnable the living of 'Balanced Lives' by having Harmony in the four Dimensions of Individual Living:\nIn Thought\nIn Behavior\nIn Work\nIn Realization & Understanding\nEnsure that students are responsible social citizens by recognizing and fulfilling their participation across:\nFamily\nSociety\nNation State & Inter-Nation\nWith Nature, Natural-Systems\nCourse Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this course, the students will be able to\n\nDistinguish between values and skills, \"happiness\" and \"accumulation\" of physical facilities, the Self and the Body, Intention and Competence of an individual, etc.\nUnderstand the value of harmonious relationship based on trust and respect in their life\nUnderstand the role of a human being in ensuring harmony in society and nature.\nAppreciate the need for 'Consciousness-development' & 'Universal Human Values and Ethics' in order to live 'Human-Consciousness'. Appreciate the need for 'Study' or 'Adhyayan' for the same.\nCourse Guidelines:\n\nThe course content follows the guidelines mentioned below, that are in the line with those recommended by the Ministry of HRD:\n\nUniversal– with respect to time, space & individual\nSecular– is not dependent on any caste, creed, religion or sect\nRational– in the sense that it appeals to human reasoning\nVerifiable – It can be self-investigated and verified in living\nNatural for human being– it is naturally acceptable to every human being and there is provision in nature for its fulfillment. I.e. it does not have to be imposed & is realizable.\nCourse Methodology:\nThe methodology of this course involves a systematic and rational study of the human being vis-à-vis the rest of Existence (Nature)\nIt is free from any dogma and sectarian value-prescriptions\nIt is a process of guided self-investigation, and not of giving sermons. Whatever is found as truth or reality is stated as a proposal and the Students are facilitated to verify the same using a process of exploration that includes Scrutiny, Observation & Survey (nirikshan, parikshan, sarvekshan)\nThis process of Exploration takes the form of a dialogue between the teacher and students to begin with, and finally within the student himself/herself.\nThis exploration also facilitates students to evaluate their pre-conditionings and beliefs with respect of Goals of Life, Relationships, Lifestyle, Social and Ecological impact, etc.\nCourse Outline:\nFirst Year\n\nSemester-1: Introduction to Coexistence of Living\n\nSemester-2: Basic elements in Consciousness Development, Human Values\n\nSecond year\n\nSemester-1: Behavior-centric Humanism & Human Values\n\nSemester-2: Spiritualism and Materialism – Coexistentialist View\n\nThird year\n\nSemester-1: Behavioral Sociology & Human Values\n\nSemester-2: Cyclical Economics & Human Values\n\nCourse Books:\nFirst Year:\n\nIntroductory Collection, Adhyayan Bindu & Jeevan Vidya an Introduction: Parichaytmak Sankalan, Jeevan Vidya ek Parichay – Madhyasth Darshan, Sah-astitva-vaad (Coexistentialism) by A Nagraj, Jeevan Vidya Prakashan, Amarkantak, India\n\nSecond Year:\n\nBehavioral Humanism, Realization-centric Spiritualism & Resolution-centric Materialism: Vyawharatmak Janvaad, Anubhavatmak Adhyatmavaad, Samadhanaatmak Bhoutikvaad – Madhyasth Darshan, Sah-astitva-vaad (Coexistentialism) by A Nagraj, Jeevan Vidya Prakashan, Amarkantak, India\n\nThird Year:\n\nBehavioral Sociology, Cyclical Economics Vyawharvaadi Samajshastra, Avartansheel Arthshastra – Madhyasth Darshan Madhyasth Darshan, Sah-astitva-vaad (Coexistentialism) by A Nagraj, Jeevan Vidya Prakashan, Amarkantak, India\n\nReference Books:\n\nHolistic-view of Human Behavior, Human Work, Human Practice & Human Realization: Vyawhaar Darshan, Abhyas Darshan, Karm Darshan, Anubhav Darshan – by A Nagraj, Jeevan Vidya Prakashan, Amarkantak, India\n\n[ More ]\n\nConcept Note for Higher Education\n\nFirst Year Syllabus: Human Values course in Higher Education\n\nUniversal Human Values courses (UHV) – experiments in professional courses"

Nagraj\nContact Us\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nOur Plan for Societal Change\nThe Reasoning\n\nWe have 'understood' that the only long-term solution to humankinds myriad personal, familial, social, economic & ecological problems is a qualitative transformation in the level of consciousnesses in every human. Humankind needs to 'awaken' to every dimension of humanness & reality, this is called 'jagriti'.\n\n1. For General Public Awareness\n(Lok Shiksha Yojana - Jeevan Vidya)\n\nTo start the change - Change people\n\nOur open programs for the general public (ages 18-90) consist of introductory workshops followed by intensive study programs. There is no 'fee' for the 'teaching'. These consist of 7 Day Introductory, familiarization sessions, followed by intense, formal Study Programs that last from 6 months to 3 years. These are followed by ongoing discussion groups.\n\n2. Humanization of Education\n(Shiksha Sanskar Yojana - Education & Right Values)\n\nTo start the change - Change people\n\nOffering: Consciousness Development via Human Values (Chetna Vikas Mulya Shiksha or CVMS). This consists of a comprehensive overhaul of the current Education Paradigm based on this new discovery.\n\nSchool Education:\nComplete replacement of the goals, pedagogy, content and outcomes of prevailing education. From Class 1 through 12.\nSupplementing the Content in Existing Education - humanization of existing education\nColleges: Supplementary Human Values course to aid development of discernment in pupils. Research projects.\n3. Self Governing Family based Organization model for the World.\n(Parivar Mulak Swarajya Vyavastha)\n\nTo sustain change - have humane systems\n\nThe Family is proposed as the basic unit of human organization, just as atoms are, of the material world. A set of resolved (samadhanit) individuals live in family units fulfilling the material, behavioral, intellectual and spiritual needs of the human, in line with social-law and natural-law.\n\nFive Dimensions of Society:\n\nEducation & Sanskar | Health & Regulation | Production & Work | Exchange & Storage | Justice & Security\n\nTen Staged World Organization:\n\nA representative from each Family will participate in the five dimensions above, across the following 10 Stages:\n\nFamily > Group of Families > Village > Group of Villages > Block > County > Districts > States > Nation States > World"

Nagraj\nContact Us\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nSystems for Living: Family Based Organization\n\n(परिवार मूलक ग्राम स्वराज्य व्यवस्था)\n\nVision\n\nThe ultimate goal is to enable self-sustaining human settlements on this planet to create a “Universal Human Order living in Harmony” that lives with the universal human goal of:\n\nIntellectual resolution in every Individual -leading to happiness\nMaterial prosperity in every Family – leading to peace\nTrust in society – leading to satisfaction\nCoexistence with Nature – leading to bliss\n\nThe following 5 Dimensional societal systems would be needed to ensure the fulfillment of the above human 4 objectives or human target. Work is underway in all these Dimensions.\n\nHumane Education based on Right values\nConsciousness development based value education to ensure right understanding in every individual/child\nHolistic Health based on Discipline\nFor nurturing and maintaining the body\nSocially meaningful & environmental friendly Production based on Work\nFulfill material needs of the family (producing in line with harmonious principles in nature)\nJust & fair Exchange systems based on Storage\nFulfill Material needs (based on mutual fulfillment and not exploitation)\nHumane Justice & Security\nTo protect ‘human-ness’ and enrichment of the entire Nature (co-existence with nature)\n\nThis becomes the basis for a Universal Human Order – from Family Organization to World-Family Organization, starting from a family -> to a group of families -> to the village -> group of villages -> county -> block -> district -> state -> nation state -> inter-nation.\n\nImplementation\n\nPeople & families living in the various study locations are implementing and experimenting with:\n\nMutual fulfillment via behavior & justice,\nNature-friendly ways of sustainable Agriculture, Dairy and Energy Technologies\nCooperative Exchange mechanisms that are free of exploitation and adulteration.\nPublic education based on responsibility & generosity – not for money or private gain\nSchool education as a responsibility to the next generation\nNatural ways of maintaining health & holistic healing.\n\nThe people engaged in the study & practice of Madhyasth Darshan, jeevan vidya, have amongst them rich expertise in the above fields. The basic idea is to live according to this understanding, existential principles, according to intellectual-law, social-law and natural-law. Once this has been achieved in one place or a few locations, this will replicate itself, just as a single seed can replicate itself to form trees, and ultimately, an entire forest.\n\n– shriram n | student | december 2016"

Nagraj\nContact Us\nImportant note on 'Centers'\n\"MCVK Indore\" Caution Note\nBasis for listing a 'recommended center'\n\nAnyone that came in touch with (late) Shri A.Nagraj and/or Madhyasth Darshan literature is free to 'teach' or start a 'center' institution, etc using the Madhyasth Darshan tag. There is no 'granting agency' that permits or validates a center.\n\nThe 'centers' or locations must ideally have certain characteristics in line with Madhyasth Darshan teachings.\n\nHow 'we' Function\n\nJeevan Vidya, Madhyasth Darshan does not have a 'central committee' of any kind and follows a broad, decentralized model that is mutually cooperative. Individuals /Families living at a location are responsible for their own decisions. They are not 'monitored' by any 'outside group'. Individuals & Families from across the Country have taken up certain responsibilities of their own accord (such as website, sms, printing, distribution, sammelan, textbooks, research work, translations etc) & carry them out in consultation with other friends.\n\nThose that have been with this darshan since a long time periodically come together as various assemblies (सभा) & share their common concerns in various platforms/groups. The discussions/ decisions in such 'sabhas' are reflections of the individual understanding (समझ), perspectives (दृष्टि) & discrimination (विवेक) of its participants.\n\nMembers thus join the activities /groups they agree with or are interested in and this is how 'things get done'.\n\n~\n\nThe final proposed method of working is Family based Village Organisation(पारिवार आधारित ग्राम व्यवस्था संस्थान) in which assembly-committees or 'sabhas' consist of awakened individuals (जागृत व्यक्ति). Till such time, each location/center functions based on its understanding & practice which are a reflection of its inhabitants, which are constantly evolving.\n\nPeople from these locations meet periodically to share their individual and collective progress at goshtis and the rashtriya sammelan (national confluence).\n\nAll this put together is 'we'.\n\n~\n\nImportance of \"Stable Reference\" for the student\n\nWe recommend that the serious student keep the Original Works of Shri A.Nagraj as the reference baseline for their study. Any 'center' or location exists to only facilitate a student/aspirants study and provide a space for them to learn & practice.\n\nIt thus becomes imperative to choose the 'appropriate person & place' to further one's study.\n\nAn in-person survey of the locations below is highly recommended before one finalizes a place to pursue ones study or stay. It is important to keep in mind the Method of Study (अध्ययन विधि).\n\nThis is so until such time that a few of us do not become full realized (in developed consciousness) ourselves. ऐसे में अधिकांश लोग निश्चित मध्यस्थ दर्शन के इस पूरे की व्यापकताओं को निश्चित मध्यस्थ दर्शन के आधार रहेंगे। जागृति की पहचान मध्यस्थ दर्शन आधार, प्रमाण मानकर रहेंगे। इससे ही निश्चित दर्शन रहने वाले हैं।\n\nPage last updated by Shriram Narasimhan on 11 Aug 2020, 01.01.2023"

Nagraj\nContact Us\nMCVK, Indore, no longer ‘Madhyasth Darshan Center’\n\nManav Chetna Vikas Kendra (MCVK) Indore, is no longer a recommended location for the introduction to Jeevan Vidya or Madhyasth Darshan adhyayan.\n\nSee the recommended centers list here and also the basis for recommending a center.\n\nMCVK Indore Caution Note | MCVK इंदौर सावधानी पत्रक\n\nRarely, an existing center may be omitted from the ‘recommended list’ since they are found to not be having some or all the needed characteristics (free of pardhan, parnaari-parpurush & parpeeda…towards other centers & co-students, respect for distance between men & women, etc).\n\nFor instance, MCVK Indore मानव चेतना विकास केंद्र, इंदौर as of 17th August 2020 has been omitted from this list until further change due to straying away from these characteristics. An unfortunate series of misrepresentation, misinterpretation, etc have caused this.\n\nThis is not unexpected in the evolution of any darshan, where practitioners tend to ‘mix’ their previous pravritti or tendencies with that given in the ‘darshan’. This can be ‘rectified’ by sticking to the ‘adhyayan-vidhi’ by Shri Nagaraj. A group of concerned students have furthered a caution note, which can be read here.\n\nEvery person is free to pursue their path wherever they deem fit.\n\nकभी-कभार, कोई स्थान हमारे सुझाए गए स्थानों से लोपित किया जाता है, क्योंकि वहां के कार्य एक या अनेक आवश्यक नियमों का उल्लंघन किये हैं, अथवा वहां के कार्य स्थगित हो गए हों।\nउदाहरण के रूप में MCVK इंदौर, १७ अगस्त २०२० से यहाँ से लो‍पित किया गया है, क्योंकि वे कुछ नियमों से भटक गए हैं। कुछ दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण मिथ्यावचन, अपविवेचन के कारण यह हुआ है।\n\nकिसी भी दर्शन के विकासक्रम में यह असामान्य नहीं है, क्योंकि प्रचलित प्रवृत्तियों एवं पूर्व मान्यताओं को ‘दर्शन’ के साथ मिला लेते हैं। इसका परिषोधन, नागराजजी द्वारा दिए अध्ययन विधि को मानने से हो सकता है। कुछ चिंतित विद्यार्थियों ने एक सावधानी पत्रक प्रकाशित किया है, जिसे आप यहाँ पढ़ सकते हैं।\n\nप्रत्येक व्यक्ति, जहाँ उचित समझे, वहाँ अपने मार्ग का अनुसरण करने के लिए स्वतंत्र है।"

Subjects are taught as seen from within this ‘human-frame of living’.\nIncludes laws in the natural sciences, laws of behaviour, social laws, and law in intellectual spheres.\nAddresses universal human aspirations of happiness, peace, understanding, prosperity, good character, etc.\nIncludes expectations of the Family, Society and Nation from the student, and vice-versa and their interactions thereof.\nNeeds, Capabilities & commensurate learning & practices in the life stages of the human: childhood, youth, adult and old-age; whilst living in the Individual, Family, Society, Nation and Inter-Nation spheres.\nReduce info load, increase practice of relevant skills (math, science, geo) and ‘core-concepts clarity’ focus\nPedagogy & School environment\nBased on a deep understanding of the conscious aspect (chaitanya jeevan and its precise functioning) and the true nature of ‘spirituality’ based on actual existential knowledge, not just mystical intuition or estimations.\nEnabling to ‘see & live’ instead of only ‘learn & reproduce’: guided exploration\nAll enviroments the child lives in are take into consideration – in the school, and outside.\nSchool is an extension of the behavioural environment at home, including affection, care, mutual respect, cooperative responsibilities, seva etc.\nTeacher is in the role of the guru and is responsible for the overall development of the child to to fruition as a complete-human being. Based on personal ‘guru-shishya sambandh‘. The childs development forms part of the teachers practice towards their own personal improvement.

This is because the content and process of humane education yet remain to be identified in a universal manner. While theism/spiritualism could not enunciate their proposals in a universal manner, materialism/science has not been able to provide a way for universal goodness.\n\nWhereas, we can observe that every human child expects justice since birth, desires for right behavior and work and speaks the truth. The child does not know the above realities (Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth). It depends on education & human tradition (the environment) in order to understand these.\n\nSince human tradition as yet does not have a common clear understanding of the truth, beliefs by name of Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth are commonly accepted by various human communities. Accepting such beliefs, or the combination thereof, we grow up to be adult citizens, with our own varying set of notions & assumptions of right & wrong. This has resulted in the confused state we are in today.\n\nWe can hence brief the need for human education as follows:\n\nWe humans live our lives based on our assumptions, beliefs and understanding. Humans conform to their assumptions/values or sanskar, unlike animals whose behavior and living is according to their race. If our beliefs change, so do our behavior, goals and actions.\nHumans have the ability of imagination & freedom of action. This is why we end up having different beliefs and differing behaviors. Whereas, we see that every other entity in nature: be it soil, metals, plants and animals exhibit a definite conduct. Humans are yet to have a definite conduct.\nThere is a basic innate expectation & desire in every human to have right understanding and live rightfully with definiteness.\nThere are realities in existence in the form of Justice, Religion (innate-order) & Truth. (nyaya-dharma-satya) and the right humane way of living\nWe can use our imagination abilities to understand these truths and the correct ‘way of living’\nThe role of education thus is to enable every human to use their faculty of imagination to understand these realities of existence & human life as they are and live accordingly: spiritually, intellectually, emotionally (in behavior) & in occupation (materially). This leads to definite human conduct & then reflects as coexistence & harmony in living in families, society, nation-states and with nature.\n\nWe can hence summarize as follows:\n\nHuman beings belong to the ‘knowledge-order’. Our fundamental need is knowledge.\nHumans have the expectation to understand the truth about everything, including their living\nThere are such realities in existence and the possibility that we can understand them\nHumans have the capability for such understanding.\nThe role of education is to enable this understanding.\nView of Reality/world view/ Ontology\n\nOur content and pedagogical process of education is based on a fundamental and deep understanding of the human conscious, mind & psychology as it is in reality. This is enabled by the Madhyasth Darshan philosophy, or saha-astitva-vaad (coexistential thought). Simply put, existence (reality) is in the form of coexistence, is in harmony. There is spontaneous evolution in existence, and the occurrence of the world consisting of conscious entities – both animals and the human beings as we know it.\n\nHumans on this planet are in a state of ‘awakening progression’ in our consciousness, in a state of illusion, wherein our understanding is partial and our plane of living is akin to that of animals. The human being has been identified as belonging to the ”knowledge-order’ (gyan avastha). Knowledge is the fundamental human need. The basic need for the human being is happiness, and this is possible via knowledge that leads to development to ‘human consciousness’ & living with ‘awakening’. See here for a brief summary of this philosophy.\n\nRole/Objectives of human education\n\nHumans are disposed towards goodness and knowledge of the Truth, because its necessity and possibility exist in reality. Education enables the actions, conduct & study worthy of understanding the truth.\n\nUnhappiness, lack of peace & dissatisfaction in the human itself is conflict and these in turn are themselves the results of conflict. Human necessity is happiness, peace, satisfaction & bliss which is possible via knowledge of & living in human-consciousness.\n\nEnabling this transformation to human consciousness & its expression in living is thus the basic purpose of education. Education enables the arising of civility & culture in a human being. An awakened human being lives with resolution in themselves, with material prosperity in family, trust & cooperation in society & coexistence with nature.\n\nEducation enables the awakening and expression of all four dimensions of the human: a) realization/understanding, b) thought/imagination, c) behavioral/social & d) occupational/natural. This addresses the spiritual, intellectual-logical, emotional and material needs of the human. It enables mental healthiness or intellectual balance, social balance and natural balance. It enables qualitative change from inhuman characteristics to humane characteristics and nature.\n\nSuch an educated individual then goes on to establish/play their role in humane culture, civility, norms & societal organization. The role of education is to provide the content, process and environment for this transformation in an individual & work synergistic-ally with other societal systems in a manner that are in line with universal human goals.\n\nWe can thus summarize that manifestation or appearance of existence itself is discovery and invention by the human being. The generalization process of this understanding in humankind itself is education. Understanding becomes commonly available via education & publicity."

It is not based on past or existing human theories.\n•\nIt clarifies the origins, existence and precise relationship between the conscious (spirit & mind) and matter, with profound implications for us humans.\n•\nIt is practical & teachable resulting in individual happiness, peace etc & humane virtues such as kindness.\n•\nIt provides all-round resolution to our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems, allowing us to make sense of living. It enables us to have comprehension of every aspect of existence (reality) & human life\nBackground\n\nMadhyasth Darshan (Jeevan Vidya) or 'Coexistential Philosophy' has come about via original existential exploratory-research by (late) Shri A Nagraj of Amarkantak, India (originally from Hassan, Karnataka). It is a new discovery that inaugurates the fundamental nature of the Universe, Human Being, Consciousness & Human purpose.\n\nThis is not based on any religious belief or sect, but on natural laws, on reality. This is an ‘existence based human focused contemplation’. This Coexistential Philosophy (Coexistentialism) is being presented as an ‘Alternative’ to Materialism(Science) and Theism/Spiritualism for evaluation and study by humankind.\n\nSalient Points\n\nThis philosophy is comprehensive. It examines, & provides\nan integral-view of all dimensions of human life:\n\nIntellectual\n(logical, rational)\nSpiritual\n(existential, experiential)\nBehavioral\n(emotional)\nMaterial\n(sensory,\noccupational)\nIt does not\n•\nTalk of 'renunciation' or 'negate' the world we live in — it rather explains it.\n•\nTalk of 'indulgence' in the world — it rather lights up our relationship with it.\n•\nIs not a lesson in morality — rather the uncovering of the natural state of being in every human.\nIt enables freedom\n•\nFreedom from prevailing individual criminality & communal mentality between peoples.\n•\nFreedom from illusion (delusion).\n•\nIt comes in education: is universal, verifiable & free of mysticism.\nIt is practiceable\n•\nIt can be studied and understood by every human logically & intuitively.\n•\nIt has a definite method of study by which we can have realization.\n•\nIt comes in education: is universal, verifiable & free of mysticism.\nIt is Liveable\n•\nEnables human character: morality in wealth, behavior & marital life.\n•\nEnables virtues like simplicity, generosity, kindness & benevolence.\n•\nWe can understand ourselves as humans and fulfill our relationships in family, society, and nature. We can live purposeful and meaningful lives.\n\nIt has all-round solutions for the myriad problems\nall of us face, the world faces:\n\nPersonal strife\nand meaninglessness\nInterpersonal issues\nwith people – in the family & around\nSocietal conflict\nlike war & exploitation\nEcological problems\npollution & resource depletion\nBasic Message\n\nExistence is in the form of Coexistence of material, conscious and spatial realities.\n\nHuman being is the combined form a conscious Self (jeevan) & Material Body.\n\nHumans on this planet are currently in a state of incomplete understanding, or illusion.\n\nWith the Knowledge & living of Coexistence, all human problems can be resolved.\n\nThe Literature\n\nConsists of a set of 12 books originally written in Hindi, not based on any past or current texts.\n\nThey contain a Study of:\n\nExistence & evolution (reality)\nConsciousness: its origins, development & awakening\nThe Human Being & Human Purpose\nHumanness & Living - recognizing & fulfilling all relationships & values\nHumane (Undivided) Society - culture & civility (sanskriti, sabhyata)\nHumane (Universal) Systems - education, health, justice, production & exchange\n\nA study of every aspect of everything.\n\nNew Darshan (philosophy, view of reality)\nPhilosophy of Human Behaviour\nmanav vyavhar\ndarshan\nPhilosophy of Human Action\nmanav karma\ndarshan\nPhilosophy of Human Practice\nmanav abhyas\ndarshan\nPhilosophy of Human Realisation\nmanav anubhav\ndarshan\nAlternative Dialectics (vaadas)\n'Resolution-centric Materialism'\n(samadhanatmak\nbhoutikvad)\nInstead of Conflict-centric Materialism: dvandvatmak bhoutikvad\n'Realisation-centric Spiritualism'\n(anubhavatmak\nadhyatmavad)\ninstead of Mysticism-centric Spiritualism: rahasyatmak adhyatmvad\n'Realisation-centric Spiritualism'\n(vyavharatmak\njanvad)\ninstead of Struggle-centric Humanism: sangharshatmak janvad\nAlternative Codes for Living (shastras)\n'Cyclical Economics'\n(avartansheel\narthashastra)\nInstead of Conflict-centric Materialism: dvandvatmak bhoutikvad\n'Behavioural Sociology'\n(vyavharwadi\nsamajshastra)\nInstead of Consumption based Sociology: bhogonmaadi samajshastra\n'Consciousness oriented Psychology'\n(manav sanchetnavadi\nmanovigyan)\nInstead of Desire based Psychology: kamonmaadi manovigyan\nProposal to humankind\n\nThis philosophy is logically consistent and enables us to deal practically with the phenomena in nature, and verify it via direct experience and as proof in living - it is thus free of mysticism. This philosophy provides remarkably clear & precise definitions for every aspect of human living. This understanding & model of living is now available for study & practice.\n\nA diverse set of people are now seriously evaluating this proposal. Efforts to bring this into education are underway in India.\n\n~\n\nThis is a proposal for Universal Good.\n\nThe human search for the origins, nature & purpose of 'coexistence' is over.\n\nIt is now available to all.\n\nThe expectation of 'knowledge' from India that has existed from time immemorial, has now been completed.\n\nसुदूर विगत से भारत से जो ‘ज्ञान’ की अपेक्षा रही, वो पूरी हो चुकी है\n\n~\n\n*# See this schematic that illustrates the placement of 'Madhyasth Darshan vis a vis other bharatiya darshans.\n\nTerms:\nMadhyasth (मध्यस्थ) – means Mediating, the stabilizing aspect in Existence.\nDarshan (दर्शन) –Direct insight into reality and its exposition\nSaha-Astitva-vad (सह-अस्तित्ववाद): Philosophy or Coexistentialism, is the dialectics\nJeevan (जीवन) – name for the conscious aspect, unit\nJeevan Vidya (जीवन विद्या) – Program for public dissemination of the knowledge of ‘Jeevan’"

We want to be happy, be peaceful, contented, etc.\nThe outcome of Study is ‘consciousness transformation’ or awakening. When we are awakened we can ‘see’ the natural order of everything that exists. We thus have a resolution (samadhan) for all states we live in. This is happiness.\nWe thus live in ‘human-consciousness’, express our awakening, happiness and humane-conduct. This is our ultimate goal, the human goal.\nObjective of Study\n\nThe objective of Study is transformation from ‘animal consciousness’ to ‘human consciousness’:\n\nFreedom from wrongful mentality (अपराध मुक्ति)\nFreedom from Illusion, via Knowledge of reality\nLiving with humanness – with feelings such as trust, affection, care and love in our relationships\nParticipation: ensuring we promote an undivided human society and natural world order\nExperience and express happiness, peace, contentment & joy as a result of the above.\n\nThe approach to Study of Madhyasth Darshan consists of 2 broad Phases:\n\nPhase#1: Preliminary evaluation to ascertain one's seriousness\n\nThe first step is ‘Preliminary Evaluation’ to clear our doubts. We test the need and validity of the proposal for ourselves and all of humanity. We start by attending introductory workshops.\n\nWe evaluate this proposal via Scrutiny, Examination & Survey (निरीक्षण, परीक्षण, सर्वेक्षण) in the workshops, discussions and reading of the books and finding that it fulfills our need & conditions for knowing & living.\n\nThere are 4 Parameters for Testing the validity of this proposal through-out the process of study:\n\nUniversal for all places & people (naturally acceptable to me, rational, experiential)\nPerennial – for all time (natural to existence)\nLivable: (harmony with humans and nature)\nCommunicable: from one human to another\n\nThis phase thus convinces us to commit ourselves wholly to this endeavour or ‘way of life’.\n\nPhase#2: Study & Practice (अध्ययन और अभ्यास)\n\nOnce doubts have been cleared in the ‘preliminary evaluation’, and we don’t have any other alternatives for knowing and living, we commit ourselves to serious Study & Practice of the proposal. This broadly consists of:\n\nI) Practice of Textual Study\nSystematic study & understanding of the subject matter in the Literature in a logically-consistent manner\nGet an intellectual-view of the nature of Reality, and the basic program for a Human\nII) Practice in Humane Living\nWe practice the laws of living we’ve understood in our daily life.\nThese include righteousness in wealth, marital life (chastity) and kindness in behaviour.\nWe recognise the relationships we live - in family and beyond, and fulfil them.\nIII) Practice Meditation/Reflection\nThis is a process of distillation where we derive inferences from our Study & Practice in Living\nWe strive to continually focus on the realities we seek to have knowledge of our conscious-self and its many faculties or activities, of the various dimensions of reality/existence, and of humane conduct or living.\nThis process leads to gradual clarity as glimpse (bhaas) and semblance (abhaas) in understanding and living.\nOur success is in being able to have direct-perception (sakshatkar) of such realities\nSuch clarity or insight enables an evolving transformation in our level of consciousness.\n\nSee a more technical description in Method of Study\n\nWhat Study is not\nStudy (adhyayan) is not merely a ‘bookish’ exercise to be done on a desk. Study takes place with a competent person, a teacher – in whom the meanings of words reside as ‘knowledge of reality’.\nThis is not merely an ‘intellectual exercise’; but one that manifests in living and necessitates investigation of & living in human-relationships and relationship with the rest of nature.\nThis is not a ‘part-time’ pursuit. Serious study – (in order to become awakened, complete with knowledge) requires full time commitment to Study and Practice and needs changes in lifestyle and our perspectives (drishti).\nThe study of reality according to Madhyasth Darshan does not include any ‘prevalent meditative-practices’, ‘need to close one’s eyes’, ‘chanting’ or ‘mystical-experiences’.\nMadhyasth Darshan does not derive from other darshans or philosophies. This is being mentioned here in order to avoid confusing this with existing theories, where the words used are similar, but with a totally different intended meaning.\n\n<-- Back to Adhyayan Prakriya Main Page\n\nshriram n | student | jan 2016"

Knowledge is Happiness\n2. Existence (reality) is Coexistence\n3. Harmony in Living\n4. One Human Race, One Human Religion\n5. Undivided Human Society, Universal Order\n6. Objective and Scope of Jeevan Vidya\nKnowledge is Happiness\n\nEverything that exists is called ‘Existence’. Today, we have come to assume that things are in random arrangement, that the Universe is in chaos. However, the reality is that Existence is co-existence itself, is in harmony, in orderliness.\n\nThe ‘things’ we see around us – animals, plants and things like stones, minerals, etc are in ‘self-organization’ and participate in the larger orderliness. We see the following situation today:\n\nHuman Understanding and Harmony\nHuman-Nature Relationship:\n\nAs a result of not being in self-organization, the human is unable to fulfill his relationship with the other three natural-orders in nature (animals, plant and material).\nThis manifests as the ecological problem.\n\nHuman-Human Relationship:\n\nThe human is also not able to fulfill his relationship with other humans.\nThis manifests as economic problems, social problems, problems in relationships, in criminal mentality, war, exploitation, etc.\n\nWithin:\n\nThe human is also unresolved within: has internal contradictions, a lack of clarity, self-doubt. This manifests as ‘indefinite conduct’ or ‘indefinite behavior’. The result is unhappiness within. This unhappiness within itself manifests as problems around: with other humans and the rest of nature. We human beings are thus unresolved – within and without. This is collectively called unhappiness or dissatisfaction.\n\nThe reason for the above issues:\nThe ‘Self’\nExistence (all that exists)\nMan's purpose and relationship with the units in existence (Humane Conduct)\n\nThe human being wants to live in orderliness, in harmony, in happiness. The need for happiness-satisfaction is only fulfilled by having knowledge (right understanding) while the need for ‘physical things’ is fulfilled by material goods. The need for ‘knowledge’ is a fundamental human need.\n\nOn having knowledge about the self, existence & humane conduct, the human becomes resolved, and this results in happiness. Having this knowledge fulfills the humans existential, intellectual, logical, ethical, moral, emotional and sense-organ related needs.\n\nKnowledge or ‘right-understanding’ provides the basis for our imagination, of our desires, of our conclusions on physical reality as well, hence, knowledge is the very basis for our living.\n\nKnowledge is:\nKnowledge of all that exists. [अस्तित्व दर्शन ज्ञान]\nKnowledge of the conscious self : [जीवन ज्ञान]\nKnowledge of perfect-Humane Conduct: (मानवीयता पूर्ण आचरण ज्ञान)\n\nThis is to inform you that:\n\n“Co-existence” (reality) has now become study-able. Existence (Reality) has been understood as a Coexistence of physiochemical (insentient), conscious (sentient) & a ‘pervasive-entity’ which we currently identify as ‘space’ or ‘void’.\n\nThe human-being has been understood as being the combined form of a conscious unit and a physiochemical body. The conscious unit and nature of ‘consciousness’ has been understood.\n\nThe ‘Human purpose’ in existence has been understood and man’s ‘being’ and ‘living’ has become clear. Universal human conduct, values, religion* and race have been understood. (*religion = dharma = adherence = inseparability)\n\nExistence (reality) is Coexistence\n\nExistence, is just not just the ‘material’ things we ‘see’ around us (like rocks, plants, etc) , but also consists of ‘space’ and conscious units, called ‘jeevan‘. Thus, ‘Coexistence’, means the existence of material & conscious units in all pervasive ‘space’. There is a definite ‘progression’ in Existence: plants evolve from matter, and animals evolve from plants and so on. We can understand progression and the definite direction in existence from the following 5 lines:\n\n1. Existence is Coexistence:\n\nThe nature of existence is not just physio-chemical, but all physical, chemical, and conscious (jeevan) entities are inseparably present in the all-pervasive ‘space’ or ‘void’.\n\n2. There is evolution in Existence:\n\nThere is evolution or ‘development progression’ in Existence: The formation of atoms, many species of atoms, molecules, larger formations are naturally occurring. The evolution of living life, plant life from matter, and its thousands of species and their propagation is also on its own. The atom is the basic unit in existence, in which development takes place. The atom has a madhyasth or mediating force/power that is in the central part (nucleus). This nucleus or central part of the atom or madhyasth force/power is responsible for regulating the other particles in the atom and maintaining its structure/constitution\n\n3. There is ‘development’ in Existence:\n\nThe progressive development in the atom yields an atom in which there can be no longer be any change in structure or constitution. This is called constitutional-completion or ‘गठनपूर्णता’. This singular atom becomes free of the bondage of molecular-association and weight – it is weightless. This atom is indestructible, hence ‘immortal’. This atom is the conscious Self (I). It has its own volition, with the ‘will to live’. We see in animals – they have the will to live, whereas, plants only live. We see the evolution of many species of animals – on land, water and in the air. Each animal is able to propagate its own species.\nThe Animal consists of the conscious self or jeevan in coexistence with the material body.\nThe Human being consists of the conscious self jeevan in coexistence with the material body. The conscious self or ‘I’ given the name jeevan is a constitutionally complete atom.\nThe human being has no role to play in any of this. All this is happening by itself.\n\n4. There is Awakening Progression in Existence:\n\nHumans appear on the scene, with a more evolved body than animals. We not only have the will to live as in animals, but the will to live with happiness. In our quest for happiness, we have learnt to deal with and modify our surroundings. We have explored the material world & fulfilled our material needs via food-clothing-shelter & transport-radio-television.\nWe are now learning to live with other humans, live with nature. We are trying to find out our purpose on this planet. We are in a quest for knowledge, and satisfaction. Everything we do is for happiness.\nTo be ‘conscious’ means to have the ‘will to live’. In humans, this means having the ability to think, have imagination, feelings, etc. This is what distinguishes us from animals. As conscious beings, we wonder about the things around us, and are in the process of understanding who and what we are, why we exist, and how to live\n\nReasons for the current human situation\n\nOur current ‘way’ or ability to see or perceive the world, reality, is limited to the dimensions of ‘form’ and ‘properties’. In other words, we can study & understand how things look and how they behave. All our study and understanding of the material world, including humans is currently only limited to these two dimensions. While this is useful, this is insufficient, as is evidenced by the complex problems we continue to face as a species.\n\n5. There is ‘Awakening’ in Existence: the solution\n\nWe are unable to see or apprehend the remaining two dimensions of reality of ‘innate nature’ (svabhav) & ‘beingness/religion’ (religion). In other words, we are yet unable to understand the purpose of things and how they fundamentally are. The reason for this is because we only use/access partial (4.5) faculties in the conscious self, due to which our understanding and living is limited and delusional – we have a purely mechanistic or physical view of things, including ourselves. On accessing the remaining (5.5) faculties in the ‘conscious self’, we are able to ‘see’ all four dimensions of reality: form, properties, innate-nature & beingness/religion that correspond respectively to appearance, behavior, purpose and fundamental-nature of various realities such as stones, plants, animals and humans. This gives us holistic knowledge that satisfies us spiritually, intellectually & emotionally – which itself is happiness. When all 10 activities in the conscious self are functional, it is called ‘activity-completeness’ or क्रियापूर्णता and when all 10 are expressed in living with perfection, the state is called ‘conduct-completeness’ or आचरणपूर्णता .All these changes take place in the conscious self, the jeevan.\n\nKinds of humans\n\nThus, based on their development/understanding & living, humans are found in these 2 developmental planes in which we have 5 classes of humans:\n\nplane A: animal consciousness plane (partial understanding):\n\n1) servile human    2) fiendish human\n\nplane B: human-consciousness plane (complete understanding):\n\n3) humane, 4) godly and 5) divine humans\n\nEvery human and their behavior can be understood based & explained based on the above.\n\nMan is a part of Reality. Man wants to, and can understand Reality. Reality is Coexistence. There is no ‘chaos’. Everything, except the Human, is in a state of harmony. Every unit or entity like matter, plants, animals and humans have 4 dimensions which need to be known: appearance, properties, innate-nature and beingness/ religion (रूप, गुण, स्वभाव, धर्म). In other words, we only understand how things like stones, plants, animals and humans look and behave right now, but do not understand their purpose and fundamental-nature. (स्वभाव-धर्म).\n\nOn having ‘knowledge’ the human being becomes awakened, and as a result lives in human consciousness, with happiness & humane conduct.\n\nThe table below represents which dimensions of reality humans have been able to understand or explore reasonably well using spirituality/religion and materialism/science to date, and which ones are yet to be understood. This representation is possible based on the clarity offered by Madhyasth Darshan:\n\nLegend for symbols used in the table above:\n\nSummary\n\nThe fundamental findings can be tabulated as below:\n\nSpace or the all-pervasive entity (vyapak vastu) is omnipresent. It is energy in equilibrium, manifesting as ‘energy’ in insentient matter and as consciousness in sentient matter.\n\nSpace or the all-pervasive entity is inactive, causeless, eternal and unchangeable. It is free of any effect, pressure or wave. It is not the cause of the material universe: be it sentient or insentient. In other words,the world does not arise from space or the all-pervasive entity. Sentient and insentient beings are present in the omnipresence. They are saturated: drenched, encircled & submerged in space. Space or the pervasive-entity is thus not, creator or controller and is not omniscient. It can also be given various names such as Brahman and Isvara. (if one were to draw a parallel with Indian philosophical thought).\n\nSpace or the all-pervasive entity is inactive, causeless, eternal and unchangeable. It is free of any effect, pressure or wave. It is not the cause of the material universe: be it sentient or insentient. In other words,the world does not arise from space or the all-pervasive entity.

Space or the pervasive-entity is thus not, creator or controller and is not omniscient. It can also be given various names such as Brahman and Isvara. (if one were to draw a parallel with Indian philosophical thought).\n\nPhysical matter and conscious matter are in the form of ‘activities’ or units. Each ‘unit’ of such reality has four dimensions: form (rup), properties (gun), innate-nature (svabhav) and religion (dharm). Hence, ‘form’ is as much a part of reality as the ‘formless’. We are able to see, witness different dimensions of reality depending on which faculty in the conscious self, jeevan we employ. When we employ all 10 activities/ faculties in the conscious-self or jeevan, we are able to ‘see’ or understand all these realities. This itself is the ultimate human goal.\n\nHarmony in Living\n\nOn having this knowledge, we become fulfilled. When we express this understanding, live it, it manifests as synergy or harmony all around us. We can see this harmony at the following levels:\n\n1. Harmony in Ourselves\n\nKnowledge or understanding fulfills us spiritually, intellectually & emotionally. All our questions are unanswered. We know our place and purpose. We understand & accept ‘intellectual laws’ of living. This is called ‘intellectual resolution’.\n\n2. Harmony in Human Family\n\nWe are able to recognize our relationships in family, the purpose of the family and fulfill it at all times. These relationships are in the form of a parent, children, brothers, sisters, friends, our teachers, etc. We live in the expanse of these relationships and are able to have, express and fulfill emotions like trust, respect, affection, care, guidance, worship, gratitude & love.\n\nThe physical efforts we put in enable the family to have ‘material prosperity’\n\n3. Harmony in Society\n\nSociety consists of many, many human families, living together for a common humane goal. By living in Harmony in the family, we automatically become harmonious in society. We are able to recognize and fulfill our relationship with other humans other than our own family. This is in the form of understanding & accepting universal ‘social law’. We recognize our responsibilities in Society & fulfill them.\n\n4. Harmony with Nature\n\nNature is already in a state of harmony & balance. Although it may seem that there are inconsistencies, or struggle, or competition in nature, this is not so. The struggle is in us, the viewer, that is observing nature. Only the human is not in harmony in the natural system. On understanding Coexistence, we understand & accept the universal ‘natural laws’ of living, which results in fulfilling our relationship with nature in a harmonious manner.\n\nOne Human Race, One Human Religion\n\nOn having this knowledge, we understand and recognize that every humans wants to be happy, and can be so by having knowledge of coexistence.\n\nWhen we study the human body, we recognize that although we may seem to be from different races, are of different heights and shapes, of various colors, gender, languages, etc, our body composition is the same. Everyone has a heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, brain, etc. Our anatomies are basically the same.\n\nWhereas, we can see that in animals, the constitution of the body varies from one species to the other. Hence, we can understand that:\n\nHuman Religion is One = Happiness.\n\n– based on understanding in the conscious self – resolution = happiness. The word ‘Religion’ means to be ‘bound by’. We are bound by our need for happiness, by our need for knowledge.Our Religion is Happiness.\n\nHuman Race is one\n\n– based on the similar anatomy of the human body.\n\nThe differences we see around us today are based on wrong assumptions – assumed religions based on belief and discrimination based on class, caste, gender, language, color, etc – which are nothing but illusionary. Having knowledge, we become free of such illusions & delusions.\n\nUndivided Human Society, Universal Order\n\nThe society we see today is fragmented on many lines. There are numerous basis based on which we discriminate one human from the other. This has lead us to be in a perpetual state of some form of conflict or the other, of war. The discrimination and faulty beliefs that people behold towards each other itself is the cause of terrorism.\n\nThe governance systems we are witness to today are based on the centralization of some form of ‘force’ or the other. Be it dictatorship, or feudal systems, or communist, socialist setups, or even democracy, all of them rely on the use of force and authority to varying degrees.\n\nWhereas, on having knowledge of coexistence we realize and accept the equality between all humans and our relationship with every aspect of Existence, including humans. Being in harmony with humans is Naturally Acceptable to us. When we express this relationship in family and when every family is able to express this feeling, we have an Undivided Human Society.\n\nFive Dimensional Human Program\n\nHuman Organization is needed in order to establish, sustain and further human endeavors that are in line with the Human Goal of having an awakened Society. An awakened human society fulfills the Human aim of Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction & Bliss.\n\nThere are thus two kinds of programs for us:\n\nA Program to ensure understanding or Knowledge in the conscious Self – leading to Resolution\nA program to ensure requirements of the Body – leading to Prosperity.\n\nPut together, these fulfill the Universal Human Goal of\n\nIntellectual Resolution in every Human\nMaterial Prosperity in every Family\nFearlessness in Society – leading to an Undivided Society\nCoexistence with Nature – leading to Universal Order\n\nThe program to fulfill the above Goals are in the following 5 dimensions, for which a committee needs to be formed in every village. Every family is assumed to consist of 10 members and a family shall spare one member to participate in the village organization. Every village shall consist of 100 such families, and will thus have a 10 member “village organization council”. This council shall then form 5 committees to address the following five dimensions:\n\nEducation & right values or sanskar Committee\nHealth & Discipline Committee\nProduction & Work Committee\nExchange & Storage Committee\nJustice & Security Committee\n10-staged Family based World Organization\n\nThese 5 dimensions of the Human Program can be carried out in 10 stages: starting from a single family at the first stage, to the entire world at the 10th stage. Each family elects a representative for coordinating with at the societal level, and 10 such members then go onto form a committee connecting to the next village or town.\n\nObjective of Jeevan Vidya\nFor Qualitative improvement from animal-consciousness to human-consciousness in humankind\nFor evidence of humans living with complete humane conduct, with humanness\nUndivided Human Society and Balance in Nature: For omni-dimensional solution & prosperity – Evidence of Universal Orderliness\nScope of Jeevan Vidya\nKnowledge (gyaan)\nUnderstand the human being (conscious and physical aspects)\nUnderstand entire existence (reality) & purpose of all entities in it: fundamental aspects of physical, chemical, conscious & spatial reality\nUnderstand ‘true-nature’ or definite Humane conduct\nWisdom (viveka)\nIdentification of ‘laws of living’ as: intellectual-law, social-law & natural-law\nIdentification of the Universal Human-Goal\nScience (vigyaan)\nKnowledge of activity, time & decision\nPhysical Science, Behavioral Science & Spiritual Science\n\n– shriram n | student | january 2012, updated january 2017"

This is because the content and process of humane education yet remain to be identified in a universal manner: While theism/spiritualism could not enunciate their proposals in a universal manner, materialism/science has not been able to provide a way for universal goodness.\n\nWhereas, we can observe that every human child expects justice since birth, desires for right behavior and work and speaks the truth. The child does not know the above realities (Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth). It depends on education & human tradition (the environment) in order to understand these. Since human tradition as yet does not have a common clear understanding of the truth, beliefs by name of Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth are commonly accepted by various human communities. Accepting such beliefs, or the combination thereof, we grow up to be adult citizens, with our own varying set of notions & assumptions of right & wrong. This has resulted in the confused state we are in today.\n\nWe can hence brief the need for human education as follows:\n\nWe humans live our lives based on our assumptions, beliefs and understanding.\nHumans conform to their assumptions/values or sanskar, unlike animals whose behavior and living is according to their race.\nIf our beliefs change, so do our behavior, goals and actions.\nHumans have the ability of imagination & freedom of action. This is why we end up having different beliefs and differing behaviors.\nEvery other entity in nature—be it soil, metals, plants and animals—exhibits a definite conduct. Humans are yet to have a definite conduct.\nThere is a basic innate expectation & desire in every human to have right understanding and live rightfully with definiteness.\nThere are realities in existence in the form of Justice, Religion (innate-order) & Truth (nyaya-dharma-satya) and the right humane way of living.\nWe can use our imagination abilities to understand these truths and the correct ‘way of living’.\nThe role of education is to enable every human to use their faculty of imagination to understand these realities of existence & human life as they are and live accordingly: spiritually, intellectually, emotionally (in behavior) & in occupation (materially).\nThis leads to definite human conduct & then reflects as coexistence & harmony in living in families, society, nation-states and with nature.\n\nWe can hence summarize as follows:\n\nHuman beings belong to the ‘knowledge-order’. Our fundamental need is knowledge.\nHumans have the expectation to understand the truth about everything, including their living.\nThere are such realities in existence and the possibility that we can understand them.\nHumans have the capability for such understanding.\nThe role of education is to enable this understanding.\nView of Reality/world view/ Ontology\n\nOur content and pedagogical process of education is based on a fundamental and deep understanding of the human conscious, mind & psychology as it is in reality. This is enabled by the Madhyasth Darshan philosophy, or saha-astitva-vaad (coexistential thought). Simply put, existence (reality) is in the form of coexistence, is in harmony. There is spontaneous evolution in existence, and the occurrence of the world consisting of conscious entities – both animals and the human beings as we know it.\n\nHumans on this planet are in a state of ‘awakening progression’ in our consciousness, in a state of illusion, wherein our understanding is partial and our plane of living is akin to that of animals. The human being has been identified as belonging to the ”knowledge-order’ (gyan avastha). Knowledge is the fundamental human need. The basic need for the human being is happiness, and this is possible via knowledge that leads to development to ‘human consciousness’ & living with ‘awakening’. See here for a brief summary of this philosophy.\n\nRole/Objectives of human education\n\nHumans are disposed towards goodness and knowledge of the Truth, because its necessity and possibility exist in reality. Education enables the actions, conduct & study worthy of understanding the truth.\n\nUnhappiness, lack of peace & dissatisfaction in the human itself is conflict and these in turn are themselves the results of conflict. Human necessity is happiness, peace, satisfaction & bliss which is possible via knowledge of & living in human-consciousness.\n\nEnabling this transformation to human consciousness & its expression in living is thus the basic purpose of education. Education enables the arising of civility & culture in a human being. An awakened human being lives with resolution in themselves, with material prosperity in family, trust & cooperation in society & coexistence with nature.\n\nEducation enables the awakening and expression of all four dimensions of the human: a) realization/understanding, b) thought/imagination, c) behavioral/social & d) occupational/natural. This addresses the spiritual, intellectual-logical, emotional and material needs of the human. It enables mental healthiness or intellectual balance, social balance and natural balance. It enables qualitative change from inhuman characteristics to humane characteristics and nature.\n\nSuch an educated individual then goes on to establish/play their role in humane culture, civility, norms & societal organization. The role of education is to provide the content, process and environment for this transformation in an individual & work synergistic-ally with other societal systems in a manner that are in line with universal human goals.\n\nWe can thus summarize that manifestation or appearance of existence itself is discovery and invention by the human being. The generalization process of this understanding in humankind itself is education. Understanding becomes commonly available via education & publicity.\n\nContent of Education\n\nThe basic content of human education consists of knowledge, wisdom & science covering conscious & material realities and their inter-relationships:\n\nKnowledge = Why & How things exist in reality\nWisdom = What to do – purpose and laws of living\nScience = How to live, how to do – in behavior, work & mind (Science = behavioral science or values, material science and skills)\n\nIn other words, the entire content for education is the study of physical, chemical & conscious (jeevan) activities, leading to mental balance, behavioral & social balance & natural balance. This content covers the three dimensions below:\n\n1. Self education (jeevan vidya, जीवन विद्या )\njeevan vidya – understanding myself, my activities, goals and how I am conscious, the causes for my happiness and unhappiness, my aspirations and fears as they are, in reality.\n2. Behavioral education: (value education, मूल्य शिक्षा )\nin Family: understanding my relationships with other humans: in family, with parents, brothers, sisters, etc and with friends, teachers & acquaintances. Understanding the intrinsic values in living and how they can be recognized and fulfilled\nSocial education: understanding my relationship with other humans, how human race is one and human religion is one. Understanding social-laws & human values and how to live in them\nHuman organizational education: Learning how human society is formed and what our common goals are. Learning to live in family, and the roles, duties and responsibilities, like seva or service in family. Human history.\n3. Material education: (vastu vidya, वस्तु विद्या)\nSkill based occupational education: Learning useful skills so I can earn my own living when i grow up. Learning to use my hands and feet on the rest of nature effectively – farming, carpentry, repairing things, making a mobile phone, wind generators, etc.\nMaterial science education: understanding the physical-chemical processes in nature and how they have evolved, their innate nature and characteristics. Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography & Mathematics.\nEcological education: understanding the evolution from matter to plants to animals, their inter-relationships and how they are in harmony and how to interact with and live with them in a harmonious manner. Understanding natural law.\nMultidisciplinary and holistic education\n1) Life Themes\nTakes a ‘human-centric’ view of understanding, with the experience of the seer, the student, at the center.\nBased on a sound understanding of consciousness and how it functions, with the brain.\nSubjects are taught as they integrate in the fabric of nature, and how they relate to the student and the various dimensions of real human living. i.e. human living is connected to the classroom.\nThis helps the child make connections between theoretical memory and practical experience, and develops the child’s interest in the subject, since now, it is something that ‘they need’ compared to what ‘the school wants to teach them’, since their own curiosity, happiness now depends on it.\n\nReasoning:\n\nHuman living is in the following four dimensions, and there is a specific experience or contentment we derive from these four dimensions.\nWe hence have to have the input, or understanding that can fulfill these needs.\nThe basis for these inputs has to be based on an understanding of the human being vis-a-vis reality, and this is obtained as Knowledge, Wisdom & Science (ज्ञान, विवेक, विज्ञान)\nThe subjects that can complete this understanding thus has to be communicated to the child, in an age-appropriate manner.\nAddress the 4 dimensions of Human Living\nExperential/Existential\n- Fulfilled by: Purpose, Happiness, Fulfillment & Peace.\nIntellectual/Rational\n- Fulfilled by: Language, Math, Logic & Reasoning.\nBehavioural /Relationships (i& Society)\n- In Family: Relationships, Values such as Trust, Affection, Care, Respect, Kindness\n- In Society: Ethics, Social Character, History, Civics and Culture\nMaterial/Occupational\n- Fulfilled by: Natural Sciences, Geography, and finally Skills & Technology to ensure material livelihood\nThe 5 levels / ‘spheres’ of Living\nIndividual\nFamily\nSocietal\nNation\nInter-Nation\nThe different needs, expectations & responsibilities in the various stages of Human Life\nStudent life (vidyarthi)\nHouseholder – Relationships + Economic aspects (grahastha, arthik)\nOld Age\nThe above gives rise to/enables fulfillment/happiness in Living\nSensory Fulfillment (& Material Security)\nEmotional Fulfillment (Relationships, in Family)\nPurpose based Fulfillment (Larger goals of living, Society)\nInner Peace (Due to clarity & being able to deal with various situations of life)\nContentment (From the Confidence that their vision is Comprehensive)\n\nLanguage, Math, the Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Vocational Skills, are thus seen as experienced from within the child’s world combining Intellect, Emotions, and Real Life Experience.\n\nHumans are naturally inclined towards curiosity and the need for happiness and the subjects thus naturally fulfill these needs. These connections are made clear. These are done in two ways\n\nHaving a separate integration class where this is clarified in an age-appropriate manner.\nEmbedding this understanding while teaching the individual subjects (needs the teacher to have this holistic view).\n2) Family Life, Human Character\n\nEquip the child with the clarity, sensitivity and capability to live within the Family.\n\nAs a Student\n- Relationship with parents, with siblings, friends and elders -the expectations the child has from all of them and that the Family has from them.\n- Brought out using theory, real-life obervations at home and discussions.\nAs an Adult\n- The meaning of martial life, its responsibilities, and the sanctity of Marital life. Examples are taken from home and around, bringing out the secure environment the child has at home and how it is essential to maintain and secure this for the future as well.\nOld Age\n- The sensitivities involved as we age, and the need for seva for elders at this stage in life, and how this also emotionally fulfilling for us. Children are able to relate these to the real conduct they see in their family and around.\n\nThis is rendered in an age & stage appropriate manner.\n\n3) Living in Society, Social Character.\n\nEquip adults with the clarity of social-life, its inter-dependencies and intricacies.\n\nHow I am related to Society, and how we are dependent on it. My expectations from Society\nThe deeper connection, or relationship between us as humans (goals, and all the subjects and needs and dimensions given in point #1 are the same)\nThe various things we use (food, clothing, shelter, services, etc) and need and how they are enabled by so many others in society\nThis is brought about using content and discussion on how deeply inter-twined social networks are, about how it takes so many people to come together to produce a single item, and how it is due to this inherent cooperation that we are able to live like we do.\nSocieties expectation from me\n\nAs social character. There is a basic expectation of conduct from society, and this itself is taught as social-law. Restraint in, or not hurting anyone via the following\n\nNot hurting va Mind: Not troubling or bothering anyone, or hurting them: i.e by adopting kindness in behaviour and work: restraint of the mind\nNot hurting via Body: Not harming anyone, or outraging their modesty: i.e. by respecting the sanctity of Family life, by practising chastity; restraint of the body\nNot hurting via Wealth: Not stealing, not taking what is not mine: or by following righteous wealth: restraint of source/means of acquiring wealth\n\nThese points are brought out using written content and discussions in an age appropriate manner. These are basic expectations that we too have from every human, and in turn, other humans (society) has from us. This is the bedrock on which every family is built. When any of these 3 conditions are broken, then we have social and familial distress, and lack of mental peace and self-confidence.\n\nWhen any or more of these basic rules are broken, society, and the law, call it a ‘crime’. Every definition in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) consists of these. This is brought out using live examples from news items, etc. Ex:\n\nMind: Defamation suits, mental harrasment, dowry/torture cases\nBody: Infidelity, Sexual harrasment, Gender Bias, Murder and Molestation Cases\nWealth: Theft, forgery, corruption, financial fudging, misdirecting wealth, etc cases.\n\nThis is gradually developed’ over the years to develop suitable mentality & acceptance in the child to abide by social-law. This goes to ensure a big part of “ethics & morality in social life”.\n\n4) Daily Routine and Health\n\nWhile we teach human anatomy and physiology, the basics of staying healthy are also covered. This is especially pertinent in todays scenario where the adult population in India lives a consumption based, sedentary lifestyle (in the cities) and ailments like diabetes have penetrated the villages. India is today the diabetes capital of the world.\n\nDiscussion on need to be healthy\nImportance of daily routine for smooth functioning of the various organs – examples are taken from nature, where animals too follow a natural cycle of waking, eating, excretion and sleeping, etc. ;\nImportance of daily routine – waking times, eating times, exercise, and sleeping on time are discussed.\nThe 4 seasons in India are taught and discussed and the different changes the body undergoes and its differing needs in terms of food are also discussed. Examples are brought in from home and elders traditions to enrich the same. Foods to be avoided in certains seasons and at certain times of the day are also communicated.\nHigher class students are also taught about common ailments we encounter – such as colds, fevers, wounds, etc – and how they can be taken case using home-remedies. This avoids the tendency or habit of over-medication as they grow older.\nThis daily routine is then tied to the daily-cycle-of-life we have mentioned in the first suggestion to show how this daily routine + the lifecycle of an adult, to old age: consisting of relationships, occupation/work, seva, intellectual and social pursuits, etc make for a complete and holistic experience of living.\nLearning Theory\n\nBoth environments are considered equally important as input-sources for the child:\n\nThe School environment: that includes the formal-content, teacher relationship, peers and general humane atmosphere.\nexpectations the school has from the child, and vice-versa\nEnvironment outside: at the Home, the Larger Community, Society, Culture & Nature.\nexpectations each of these have from the child & vice-versa\nChild’s /Human mind (conscious jeevan) and how it assimilates learning\nHas a desire/will or purpose – that it wants/needs (according to age)\nThis results in imagination\ninput comes from the school or outside life environment in the form of\na. Language\nb. Experiments/Practice\nc. Observations\nthe child matches theory to the observations he/she makes within and without -i.e. around, across matter, plants, animals and people\nThese lead to mental-impressions (sanskar)\nThe child assimilates/adopts these impressions depending on their tendencies (pravritti)\nThis goes on to form a conviction/belief about that subject/object/ living.\nSuch beliefs are across the Individual, Family, Societal, Nation, and the entire spectrum of Nature\n\nThis in sum develops into ‘human mindset’. This mindset is what makes us who we are.\n\nThe role of education thus is to create the necessary factors that shall enable ‘humane mindset’ in a comprehensive manner.\n\nPedagogy/Process of Education\n\nThere are realities in existence and the meanings & understanding of these realities reside in the teacher/guru. Since words are the most potent means of communication, they are used to provide direction to the pupils imagination.\n\nEducation thus, is the process of transferring this understanding or right values (sanskar) from the teacher to the student enabling the student to have these impressions of reality & live accordingly.\n\nOur process of education has the following characteristics:\n\n1. Addresses the ‘self ‘ directly\nAddresses inquisitiveness and exploration by each child, since the innate need for every human is to know – in place of mere memorization and rote learning\nRespect: Respects the freedom of imagination and freedom of action in the child allowing for their creative thinking & expressions (कल्पनाशीलता, कर्मस्वतंत्रता)\nCritical thinking: Enables students to scrutinize & evaluate using their own freedom of imagination and decide between right & wrong, true & false in their own right.\n2. Recognizes human relationship\nBased on sound teacher-student relationship – between one who knows and one who wants to know: as against it being a ‘job’ alone.\nBased on values & evaluation, as against fear and enticement. (punishment and rewards)\nFosters cooperation and mutual fulfillment with other children/ humans – in place of seeing them as opponents to compete against.\nPromotes excellence – everyone can be excellent. As against specialty & competition.\n3. Integrated approach based on reality\nSubjects taught in an integrated manner – as the inter-related fabric of the cosmos, to human life on this planet and our roles as individuals, in families, society, nation-state etc – as against fragmented teaching leading only to specialization\nAddresses all dimensions of human living: realization, thought, behavior and occupation – as against the current goal of education largely for an occupation, or ‘to make a living’\nBased on the reality of Coexistence – of Existence being in harmony, that can be known – as against material-centrist chaos/instability based view or mysticism/god centrist views.\nOutcomes of Education\n\nThe person that successfully completes such education is endowed with the following 5 qualities:\n\nHas assurance, trust in oneself and his capabilities and knowledge\nRespects excellence in the other human – recognition of who has worked for, or reached the common human goal\nHas balance in his knowledge and personality – can live according to what he/she knows\nIs sociable in behavior: pupils' living does not cause an imbalance in society: lives within the confines of marital relationship and displays kindness in behavior with other humans, lives with human values.\nIs self-sufficient in occupation: has the needed skills to work for his and family's material prosperity\nSupplementing the current educational content\n\nStudents don’t get complete knowledge in any single subject in the current Education system. Study of the following missing aspects need to be inculcated to make prevalent education complete:\n\naddition of Conscious aspect (jeevan) in Science.\naddition of Mental-Impressions (sanskar) in Psychology.\naddition of Ethical utilization of the material and conscious aspects in Economics.\naddition of Culture and Civics of Humaneness in Sociology.\naddition of Conservation and Encouragement of Humaneness in Political Science.\naddition of Activity of Matter in Philosophy (Darshan-Shastra).\naddition of Human being and Humaneness in History and Geography.\naddition of Essential Reality in Literature.\nCriterion for evaluation & acceptance\n\nThe human values via consciousness development or Chetna Vikas Mulya Shiksha (CVMS) fulfills the following criterion:\n\nUniversal – naturally acceptable to the human & natural to existence/nature – is not be an imposition\nPerennial – Timeless truths are free of the limitations of space & time.\nLogical & Verifiable – Appeals to human reasoning and intuitively & experientially verifiable\nLivable: comes in living – improves quality of understanding and living and leads to harmony with humans and nature"

The entire 3,600 pages of Madhyasth Darshan literature is to explain and express these 5 lines.\n\nThese are the 5 lines to be understood, realized:\nExistence is in the form of ‘Coexistence’\nThere is Development Progression (evolution) in Existence, in the atom\nThere is Development (progress) in Existence, in the atom\nThere is Awakening Progression (of the human) in Existence, in the conscious atom (sentient)\nThere is Awakening (of the human) in Existence, in the conscious atom (sentient)\n\nRead below for an explanation of these lines:\n\n1. Existence is in the form of co-existence, as “units saturated in space”\nExistence is coexistence\n\nExistence is not just material (physical matter) – but all physical-chemical and conscious-entities are inseparably and eternally actively-present in all-pervasive space.\n\nExistence is stable. There is no increase or decrease in existence.\nExistence has definitiveness for progress and awakening.\nAll principles in existence are natural.\nThere is harmony, orderliness in existence\nEach unit is organized within itself and participates harmoniously with the overall orderliness.\nExistence is limitless, eternal\nThere is no ‘limit’ to Existence. Wherever Existence is deemed to be ‘upto’, there is always space ‘after’ that.\nThere is no ‘cause’ for Existence, Existence is eternally-present as Coexistence. No cause for matter, or space is evidenced.\nExistence has always been ‘this way’, and will always be ‘this way’: as units saturated in space.\nVoid/Space\nIs all-pervading, hence called ‘Omnipresence’ (vyapakt)\n- There is no time and location where space is not\nSpace is not an activity; it is a state of zero-activity (kriyashunya)\n- All activities (units) are in space.\nSpace is energy in equilibrium, hence called ‘Omnipotence’ (satta)\n- Space is energy itself, is manifested in units as energy (fundamental source for energy in the Universe, in Existence)\nSpace itself is consciousness, knowledge (gyaan, chetana)\n- Is manifested in the conscious unit as consciousness\n- Is manifested in the conscious unit as knowledge\nSpace is Transparent (pardarshit)\n- Every unit is able to recognize its relationship with the other unit and fulfill it, being in space.\n- Every unit is resplendent by being in space. Every unit is resplendent with its form, properties, innate-nature & religion by being, and continuing to be in space.\nSpace is permeating (pargaami)\n- Space ‘exists’, where there is unit, and where there is not. All units are ‘soaked’ in space. There is space both ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ the unit, there is space ‘everywhere’.\nSpace is “Mediating” (madhyasth)\n- Space is in the ‘complete-state’. There is no ‘change’ in the ‘state of space’. All changes are only found in ‘units’ (activities).\n- Space is not affected by the unit, it is mediating. It has always been this way, will always be this way.\nUnits/Matter\nAre recognized by being limited from 6 sides\nAre continuously active\nAre energized while being in space (soaked in space)\nEach unit is in the form of State and Motion (stithi, gati)\n- State is the units ‘being-ness’ in itself\n- Motion is its participation in the larger orderliness\nThere can be some location where units are not, but no time when units are not.\nThere is no location, nor time, where space is not. Any ‘location’ itself is space.\nEvery unit is an inseparable presence of 4 dimensions: form, properties, innate-nature & religion.\nUnits are manifested as the four ‘natural-orders’; units = activities = nature\nThe innate-nature and religion for a given ‘natural-order’ is the same for all units in that natural-order. Natural-orders are: material-order, respirating order (praanic), animal-order, knowledge-order.\nNature saturated in Space is as attractive, repulsive and mediating activities and is limited. Therefore Space is the complete-state (perfect).\nThe smallest ‘unit’ that is in orderliness, can have direction and form.\nUnits are soaked, encircled and submerged in space. Consequently, they are energized, protected and active while being in space.\nUnits are as physiochemical nature (jad) and conscious nature (chaitanya). Physiochemical and conscious units (nature) are eternally-present in space.\nThere is no creation or destruction of units/matter/nature. There is only change in constitution (form), at the atomic level.\nInfinite activities or groups of activities itself is nature, which is recognized as physiochemical (jad) and conscious (chaitanya).\n2. There is development progression (evolution) in existence\nNature continuously manifests effort, motion, and constitution. (shram, gati, parinaam)\nThere is a development-progression or evolution in atoms. Hungry-atoms (atoms with less particles than needed) and emissive-atoms (atoms with more particles than needed) are statuses of development-progression, which manifest as a large variety of atoms.\nThe central-part (nucleus) found in every atom is the Mediating (madhyasth)-activity. Therefore, attractive and repulsive activities and relative forces (in every atom) are restrained and protected.\n3. There is development in existence (progress) in the atom\nDevelopment-progression or evolution in Existence takes place in the atom. The only progress that takes place in Existence is in the atom.\nPhysiochemical nature itself attains the conscious-plane after constitutional-completeness and becomes conscious in the form of the conscious-atom or ‘jeevan’. This itself is development (progress).\nThe conscious-atom has 61 particles, of which 1 is in the centre and the others distributed in 4 orbits: 2 in the first, 8 in the second, 18 in the third and 32 in the fourth orbit. This is the ‘jeevan’ atom. These have been respectively named as atma, buddhi, chitta, vritti and mun.\nThey have the activities of: tasting, weighing, contemplation, comprehension & realization in state (stithi kriya); and selecting, analysis, imaging, determination & evidentiality in motion (gati kriya) respectively.\nThe conscious unit has a shape, and occupies space, and is weightless. It does not ‘react’ with any physiochemical unit.\nImmediately on formation, the conscious-unit (jeevan) becomes free of the ‘bondage of weight’ and ‘bondage of molecular-formation’ and becomes equipped with the bondage of the ‘will-to-live’. It uses the body to do so and expresses this will-to-live via the body, using the brain as the medium of interaction with the body.\nUnits in the animal-order (animals) are a combined form of physiochemical body and conscious-unit, and at the same time are also a part of nature.\nHuman-being is a combined form of physiochemical body and conscious-unit, and at the same time is also a part of nature.\n4. There is awakening progression in existence, in the conscious-atom\nAwakening-progression in existence takes place in the conscious-atom (jeevan) as the sequential awakening in its activities.\nThe conscious-unit (jeevan) starts its bodily journey with the animal-body and continues to do so until the human-body is needed for its expression. This is called jeevani-kram(progression of expression of will to live).\nHuman in awakening-progression (jagriti kram) lives expressing only 4.5 activities out of 10 in the Self or conscious-unit (jeevan) and hence lives in animal-consciousness.\nThe conscious-unit, jeevan assuming itself to be the body is the meaning & cause of living in animal-consciousness. Assuming oneself to the body is the meaning of living in animal-consciousness.\nThis is the reason for problems and unhappiness at the level of the individual, family, society, nation-state and inter-nation; as well as the problems in human-nature relationship.\nHuman being living in this level of consciousness lives expressing the activity of imagination and freedom to act; via the faculties of tasting-selecting; weighing-analysis & imaging (aswadan-chayan; tulan-vishleshan; chitran). The activity of weighing is only with the perspectives of likes, health and profit. These are 4.5 activities in total when living at this level of consciousness.\nThe innate-nature of a human living in animal-consciousness is: wretchedness, cunningness & cruelty, while the subjects are: food, sleep, fear & coitus. The perspectives of living are: likes, health & profit – living is restricted to this domain.\nThere is expectation for the activities of contemplation, comprehension-determination, realization-evidentiality and consequently, the expectation for justice, religion (dharma) & truth (nyaya-dharma-satya); the expectation for happiness, and peace.\nIt is not possible to live according to ‘humane innate-nature’ and human-religion when living in animal-consciousness, neither can reality be understood in all its dimensions when living in this level of consciousness – it is only restricted to the domains of ‘form’ and ‘properties’ and hence incorrect, incomplete.\nHuman not living according to his ‘humane innate-nature’ & religion (swabhav-dharm) is the cause for human problems.\nServile-human (pashu-manav) of knowledge-order in illusion is more evolved than units (animals) in the animal-order. Servile human is operated by the beastial human.\nBeastial-human (rakshas-manav) of knowledge-order in illusion is more evolved than the servile-human in illusion.\n5. There is awakening in existence -in the conscious atom\nUnits of knowledge-order (human beings) are endowed with the capacity for realistic-view (darshan). Realistic-view (darshan) is in the sense of physiochemical and conscious nature situated in all-pervasive entity or Omnipresence.\nIt is only in the non-delusion state that realization-knowledge and realistic-view (darshan) get completed.\nAwakening in deluded human-beings itself is functional-completeness and conduct-completeness.\nFunctional-completeness is in the form of manifestation of all 10 activities in ‘jeevan’.\nThis happens via knowledge of realistic-view of Existence, knowledge of jeevan (self) and knowledge of complete-humane conduct. Awakening in ‘jeevan’ or the conscious-unit thus takes place by way of jeevan knowing its true form, properties, innate-nature, religion and the truth (coexistence = units saturated in space).\nThis results in “intellectual resolution”, which results in continuity of happiness.\nThe human living in human-consciousness lives with complete-humane conduct. This is as values, character and ethics. Values are in the form of 30 values, character is in the form of righteous-wealth, righteous marital (husband-wife) relationship and kindness in work & behavior.\nHuman living in human-consciousness is able to live fulfilling the human-goal of resolution, prosperity, fearlessness (trust in the present) & coexistence and participate in orderliness from family to world-family leading to an undivided society and universal orderliness.\nOnly the human living in human-consciousness is able to live with his true innate-nature and knows and lives as evidence his ‘religion’ as resolution, happiness.\nHuman living in human-consciousness is able to live with law-restraint-balance with the remaining 3 natural-orders and with justice-religion & truth with other humans.\n‘Human’ (manav) living in human-consciousness is more evolved than the beastial-human living in animal-consciousness. ‘Human’ lives with the innate-nature of steadfastness, courage & generosity; subjects as: progeny, wealth and fame motives and primarily evidences the perspective of justice in living.\n‘Godly-human’ (dev-manav) living in ‘godly-consciousness’ is more evolved than the ‘human’ living with human-consciousness. Godly Human lives with innate-nature of steadfastness, courage & generosity plus kindness and graciousness; subject as fame motive and primarily evidences the perspective of religion (dharma) – with justice in living.\nDivine Human (Divya-manav) with complete-awakening is more evolved than godly-human. Divine Human lives with innate-nature of steadfastness, courage & generosity plus kindness, graciousness & compassion; no motives left, lives only for beneficence and primarily evidences the perspective of truth – with justice & religion (dharma) in living.\nMan is a ‘replica’ of coexistence. He is the seer in coexistence. Existence spawned a unit that can understand Existence itself.\nConduct-completeness is in the form of all the orbital-activities in the conscious-unit fully functioning under the influence of the centre unit (atma).\nPhysical-chemical Formation & Deformation in Existence\nNature continuously manifests effort, motion, and constitution. As a result, nature itself is perceivable in four natural-orders.\n‘Formation’ implies the changes in the constitution (form) of the atom, also manifested as properties (guna) which itself is visible as the different physical and chemical formations.\nPhysical and chemical formations give rise to cells, which are manifested as vegetations and forests, insects, animal body and human body.\nDeformation implies changes in the constitution (form) of the atom, also manifested as the ceasing of activity of respiration in plants, animal body and human body.\n‘Jeevan’ or the conscious-unit does not ‘exist’ in plants and vegetations. Jeevan is only found in animals & humans. Jeevan leaving the animal-body or the human-body results in deterioration of the cells in the body and its death, which itself is deformation.\nThere is no ‘creation’ or ‘dissolution’ of ‘matter’ in existence. There is only formation and deformation.\n\n– shriram n | student | jan 2012"

Who are the people involved in this initiative?\n6. Where/How can I get started? Get involved?\n7. How can I verify the validity of the proposal?\n8. How & where can I study this?\n9. Different Terms – Madhyasth Darshan, Jeevan Vidya, Coexistentialism..what do they mean?\nyour doubts, answered…\nIs Jeevan Vidya an enforcement on me?\nIf this is the work of one person, how can it be applicable/true for everyone?\nDo you have any political affiliation? Do you take donations? How are you organized?\nIsn’t this just a combination of ‘science’ and ‘spirituality’?\nAre you promoting Eastern or Indian – Vedic wisdom? or just putting Oriental or Eastern thought in a new bottle?\nAre you against other beliefs, philosophies and ideologies/systems?\nA lot of people and thought-systems have made the same claims. How is this any different?\nThe language seems difficult & arcane….\nThis seems to be a lot of words. How does it come in living?\nOn the philosophy (darshan)\n1) Whose work is this? How did it come about?\n\nThis has been propounded by Shri A.Nagraj of Amarkantak, MP, India (Originally from village Agrahara, Hassan, Karnataka). A.Nagraj lived until the age of 96 and passed away in March 2016.\n\nThis finding was the culmination of a rigorous practice of investigation that he undertook using Indian vedic methods, and finally, a self-improvised technique. Although the background for this proposal is in the Vedas, the Madhyasth Darshan proposal does not have any connection or interest in the vedas, or any other belief system or religion, etc. Read more about A Nagraj here.\n\n2) What efforts have you made so far, and what are the results?\n\n‘We’ are not a formal organization. We are just a group of concerned, well-meaning humans. We have been working in taking this message to humanity in general using introductory workshops, rigorous full-time study study programs, as well as starting a new-alternative school, interventions in current educational curricula via value education programs both in schools and in higher education.\n\nWe are also in favor of, and practitioners of correct justice systems, health, appropriate exchange and nature-friendly technologies, agriculture, dairy and ways of living.\n\nYou can read more about us here. Read about our programs here.\n\n3) Who does this apply for? Who is eligible?\n\nEvery Human Being. Madhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya) is not affiliated or limited to any class, caste, creed, religion, sect, gender, geography or time. It is not for a ‘select few’. It applies for all human beings – from children to adults, to those that are old. It is Universal, for entire humankind. It is based on Reality – and reality is the same for every person.\n\n4) What is your Objective? What is the scope of your vision?\n\nThe basic Objective is to ensure an Undivided Human Society and Universal Orderliness on this planet, wherein human-human relationships and human-nature relationships are in Harmony, and continue to be so. We can call this Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction and Bliss, or Intellectual Resolution in every Individual, Material Prosperity in every family, Trust in Society and Coexistence with nature.\n\nSee ‘Objective & Scope‘ for more details.\n\n5) Who are the people involved in this initiative?\n\nWe are human beings. We are people like you, who want to have answers to the principle questions in their lives – in a universally consistent and verifiable manner and are concerned about the state of humankind and the state of the planet. We want to work for Universal Good. We are ‘self-sufficient’ ; we are not dependent on any contingency fund or donations of any kind. We come from a wide variety of backgrounds – from housewives to businessmen, students from marquee institutes to engineers, scientists and farmers, etc. You can go through some profiles here.\n\n6)Where/How can I get started? Get involved?\n\nReading is the first step to understanding. You can read the books, but this is not sufficient. It needs a human to explain it, since the meanings reside in the human, in the conscious aspect, the symbols for the words are in the books. Attending a 7 day introductory workshop is a good starting point. You can also visit the study locations or download some reading material here.\n\n7) How can I verify the validity of this proposal?\n\nThis is via a process of Scrutiny, Observation & Survey (निरीक्षण, परीक्षण, सर्वेक्षण).\n\nThere are 4 basic parameters of evaluation. The proposals are:\n\nUniversal (for all Humans, in all places)\nPerennial (does not change with time)\nLivable (Leading to Harmony – with humans and with nature)\nCommunicable (non-mystical, comes in Education)\nVerifiable (Using Reason, Experentially & Behaviourally)\n\nSee more in method of study.\n\nIn sum, you will need to verify this in your own right. This takes time. You cannot do the “verification” just by “reading”. You will need to first listen to this from a person, a human, for which you need to attend a workshop, or meet someone.\n\n8) How & where can I study this?\n\nThe realization comes through Adhyayan (systematic study) under the guidance of a person who has this understanding. As a result of understanding, the person starts recognizing harmony at all levels and responsibly participates in human-human systems and human-nature systems and thus produces evidence of happiness in oneself and becomes the source (inspiration) of happiness for others.\n\nRead the following\n\nAbout Study\nGuidance to Proceed and\nMethod of Study.\nVisit a study location here.\n9) Different Terms – Madhyasth Darshan, Jeevan Vidya, Coexistentialism… what do they mean?\nMadhyasth Darshan =\nHolistic View of Harmony. Basic Study of the Reality of Coexistence, set of books that enable the same.\n‘Madhyasth’ means mediating or ‘centredness’. It indicates the Centredness of Space, Centredness of the central part of every atom and the Centredness of the conscious unit ‘jeevan’\n‘Darshan’ – means understanding reality as-it-is or ‘realistic-view’. For such understanding, we need a seer, the reality being seen, and sight. I.e. for दर्शन we need दृष्टा, दृष्टि and दृश्य\nCoexistentialism (Sahastitvavaad) =\nElaborations of the realities seen at the level of ‘Darshan’\nDialectic – logical consistency and arguments for the darshan\nJeevan Vidya =\nThe awareness (education) program to make this realization (Madhyasth Darshan) accessible for all\nThe knowledge of Jeevan (conscious entity). ‘Jeevan’ is the name for the conscious aspect in a human being, what we refer to commonly as ‘conscious’ or ‘Self’ or ‘I’.\nExistence centered Human focused Contemplation (astitva moolak manav kendrit chintan) =\nContemplation (finding out the purpose, participation) of the Human Being (myself) in relation to Existence (Coexistence = all that exists, reality)\nyour doubts, answered…\n1) Is Jeevan Vidya an enforcement on me?\n\nThis proposal is not an imposition on anyone or a request for you to understand. You can understand this if you want to. The right to do so remains with you.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism does not talk of “Do’s & Don’ts” and is not a ‘belief system’. It is not something to be ‘learned’ and ‘followed’ – but to be studied and ‘understood’. If we ‘understand’ reality, it naturally comes in our living. Jeevan Vidya is presented in the form of propositions, and does not expect anything to be accepted on faith but to thoroughly examine the truth or veracity of these propositions via self-investigation, in one’s own right.\n\nReality does not belong to anyone. Reality IS. Madhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya ) is a proposal about reality. The choice & responsibility to evaluate its ability to do so, rests with you, the reader – with every human being.\n\n2) If this is the work of one person, how can it be applicable/true for everyone?\n\nThe human is the seer, or the one who understands existence. Hence, any proposal regarding reality for humankind will have to come from the human-being himself. This can be seen from numerous examples in human history, including modern-science, where an individual first proposes, and everyone else then verifies it and it then comes into general acceptance.\n\n3) Do you have any political affiliation? Do you take donations? How are you organized?\n\n“Madhyasth Darshan -Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya)” is not an “organization” or a group. It is a knowledge system, a proposal on reality, that has been written in Literature form and whose meanings reside in humans that have understood it. . “It” does not ‘advertise’ or ‘evangelize’. All humans have a need to ‘know’, and living with such knowledge results in happiness. Thus, this is a proposal for all humans. Those who want to study it; can do so – free of cost, since knowledge cannot be sold, reality cannot be ‘sold’. Everyone has the right to evaluate it, and accept or reject it after evaluation.\n\nThere is no ‘central organization’, ‘hierarchies’, ‘franchisees’, ‘certifications’ or ‘certified people’. It is not a ‘following’. There are no ‘memberships’ or ‘titles’. Has no political connection or inclinations of any nature.\nThere is no interest in money or donations of any kind. Every individual/family involved looks after their own expenses and do not get paid for the time/effort put in. We study and teach this, for ourselves.\n4)Isn’t this just a combination of ‘science’ and ‘spirituality’?\n\nNo. It may seem like it, since the words used are similar, but madhyasth darshan proposes on reality ‘ground-up’ wherein the words used are from existing human language-traditions, but the definitions/meanings have been given totally anew. It so happens that spirit, spirituality, matter, material, conscious, consciousness, can all be known and are actually all inter-related, or ‘connected’.\n\n5) Are you promoting the Vedas or Indian thought? Isn’t this just putting Oriental or Eastern thought in a new bottle?\n\nNo. Although the origins of Madhyasth Darshan lie in Indian Vedic methods of investigation into reality, the entire proposal has been given “ground-up” based on A.Nagraj’s direct-experience or realization of reality as-it-is. Madhyasth Darshan does not refer to, quote, or promote any Eastern or Oriental thought, or ‘Western Philosophies’ for that matter.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan, or Coexistentialism is being proposed as an Alternative to the ‘way of looking at reality so far’:\n\n‘Instability-Indefiniteness based physiochemical matter centric thought or Materialism’ (Science) and\n‘Secrecy/Mysticism based God centric Thought’ or Idealism (Spiritualism, Pantheism and Super-Naturalism)\n\nRead Originators Note, The Alternative\n\n6) Are you against other beliefs, philosophies and ideologies/systems?\n\nNo. Madhyasth Darshan is concerned with reality as-it-is and has proposals for the same. The Literature comments on what humankind has been able to achieve to date, and what remains to be done, and how it may be done.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan stands for an Undivided Human Society and Human Orderliness.\n\n7) A lot of people and thought-systems have made the same claims. How is this any different?\n\nYou will need to study this to really get that answer. Meanwhile, you can read the comparison in this article here. While the words used are from existing human tradition, the definitions have been given totally anew. A lot of people have attempted to understand reality, and there has been success in many aspects. Hence, many concepts may seem ‘familiar’.\n\n8) The language seems difficult & arcane….This seems tough. Is there an easier introduction?\n\nTo draw an analogy from current day science: Just because the formula for a particular chemical compound seems complicated, does not mean we change it, since by changing it, the compound (chemical reality) will not be indicated anymore.\n\nThe primary purpose of language is to communicate meanings, reality between humans. Hence, if needed, language needs to change to accommodate or indicate reality so that on listening to such words, the human can understand the meanings of the words, understand the reality.\n\nIf we have the need to understand, we can do so – and then the words do not seem difficult. If you want to understand reality: yourself, existence and human purpose; have answers you will need to understand this as-it-is. Since, if we change the words, the meanings indicated will be lost, the reality obscured. And if that were to happen, what is the whole point?\n\n9) This seems to be a lot of words. How does it come in living?\n\nWord leads to meaning. Meaning leads to understanding. Understanding comes in living. This manifests in living in behavior with other humans and in work with rest of nature. Practice in behavior and in work is an integral part of the Method of Study.

    "content": "Home\nPhilosophy\nExplore Concepts\nHuman Being\nPhilosophy\nIn Brief\nOrigins\nKey Discoveries\nLiterature\nExplore Concepts\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nHuman Being\nDefinition of the Human Being\n\nOne who actualizes his mental visions/imagination and has expectation for healthiness of mind. Since the beginning of Human history, we have used our faculty of imagination to understand our surroundings and learnt to modify and live with them. We have thus actualized our imagination, be it using tools, agriculture, to advanced machines and computer with AI, etc. We have achieved many milestones in this respect.\n\nEach one of us desires to have a healthy mind. We don’t want internal conflict. We want to be in a state if synergy – within ourselves and with our surroundings, which we can call happiness. We have yet to achieve any real progress in this regard.\n\nHuman Purpose / Goal\n\nThe universal human goal is intellectual resolution in the Self, Prosperity in Family, Trust in Society and Coexistence in Nature. Our basic purpose is to have knowledge, to be awakened, to live in ‘human-consciousness’; be happy, live with ‘perfect-human-conduct’. This is our Universal goal, whether we know it or not now.\n\nToday, we have and live a set of assumed goals which is a sum total of our impressions, the influences from the environment and our bodies. Our goals, hence are not really our own, which is why they are not stable. Which is why ‘satisfaction’ remains elusive.\n\nHuman Construct\n\nThe Human Being is combined form of the conscious jeevan and the physical-chemical body. There is quantitative change in the body from the time to conception to death. There is Qualitative change in the conscious jeevan.\n\nActivities like understanding, thinking, desiring, expecting, using logic, imagination, etc are in the conscious self or jeevan. Activities like physical transformation, digestion, breathing, eating, excretion, etc are in the Body. Every human being has the ‘freedom of imagination’ (Kalpana-sheetla) and ‘freedom of action’ (karma-svatantata).\n\nWe currently try to understand the human being solely on the basis of the body, which is not going to be possible.\n\nHuman Values\n\nThere are a total of 30 identified universal human values:\n\nUniversal values in society are: Steadfastness, Courageousness, Generosity; and Kindness, Graciousness & Benevolence.\nValues in the Self are: Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction & Bliss.\nValues in human-human relationship are: Trust, Respect, Affection, Care, Guidance, Glory, Worship, Gratitude, & Love. These 9 values reside in us as ‘established values’ and we express them in relationship as 9 ‘expressed values’.\n\nWhat we call as values today stem from some belief or imagination or expectation for humanness.\n\nLaws of Living\n\nOnce we understand reality, existence, and its inherent laws, we also understand and accept the universal laws of living for a human being:\n\nIntellectual law: ensures balance & healthiness of mind: a) non-accumulation b) affection c) knowledge d) straightforwardness e) fearlessness\nSocial law: ensures balance and regulated behaviour in societal living: a) self-wealth b) morality in marital life c) kindness in behavior\nNatural law: ensures balance and enrichment of nature: a) coexistence b) utility & complementariness\nToday, our laws of living or lack thereof are a set of assumptions based on society, culture, religion, belief and our own fancy imagination.\nHuman Relationships\n\nThere are 7 human relationships in all: Mother-Father & Son-Daughter, Brother-Sister, Friends, Teacher-Student, Husband-Wife, Colleague-Co worker & Relationship with Society/ Larger Order. The values in relationships like Trust, Affection, etc are expressed as expectations and fulfilled in these relationships.\n\nWe assume today that relationships have to be made, or forged. Whereas, relationship IS in existence. We are inalienably related to every other human. When we accept our responsibility and duty towards the other human live together, it is called family.\n\nToday, our notion of relationship is either related to the Body, or some kind of gain that comes from that association. Which is why we can ‘make’ and ‘break’ relationships today.\nHuman Character\n\nIs defined as having & living with righteous wealth, fidelity in marital relationship and displaying kindness in behaviour. Righteous wealth is defined as material goods acquired via ones physical efforts on nature, or that received as gifts or at social functions. Kindness in behaviour means letting live & live.\n\nEven today, someone that interferes in another's marital life, does harm to the others mind, or wealth, or steals, etc is called upon as a criminal and said to have bad character.\nHuman Ethics\n\nThis is defined as State Ethics and Religious Ethics. State Ethics is defined as the protection of ones body, mind & wealth. Religious Ethics is defined as the right-utilization of ones body, mind & wealth\n\nEthics can only be understood when we understand Humane Organization, its purpose, and our participation in it. Ethics today attempt to derive from morals, but since there is no Universal basis for the same, it ends being faith based. This is why Ethics are not natural today, rather we have to talk to enforcing ethics.\n\n– shriram n | student | jan 2015"

(gathan-poorn parmaanu)\n\nThis conscious-atom is imbued with consciousness, or exhibits consciousness, due to the presence of void or shunya in it. i.e. The void or brahman itself is Consciousness or ‘chetna’, and the sentient jeevan atom is ‘conscious’ due to being drenched and submerged in this pervasive consciousness or void or pervasive space, and is hence conscious or ‘chaitanya’.\n\nThe Sentient Self or ‘jeevan’ it is an atom in which there cannot be any further structural change (change of form, or constitution). As a result, it becomes ‘conscious’ (chaitanya) and co-exists with the body. This ‘conscious unit’ cannot be seen with the naked eye or via any instrument, since it is subtler than both of these. Only ‘jeevan’ can know ‘itself’; or, only ‘I’ can know ‘myself’.\n\nA human being is a combination of the conscious unit ‘jeevan’ (Self) and the physio-chemical body (jad). The activities and ‘nature’ of ‘jeevan’ can be understood.\n\nThe conscious unit is an activity; it is a “constitutionally-complete atom”. It is’ material’ in the sense it is made up of matter’ and hence a ‘substance’. It has dimensions and occupies space (has volume) but its weight cannot be ‘measured’ (weightless), whereas physiochemical atoms have weight. The conscious unit’s (chaitanya ikai) span of function is more than its length, width, and height and it has an active thinking-aspect. The physiochemical unit’s (jad ikai) span of function is limited to its length, width, and height and does not have any thinking-aspect.\n\nThe constitutionally complete atom, or the Conscious Self, (Jeevan) is:\nWeightless and not visible to the human eye or to instruments, since these are ‘grosser’ than ‘it’. The ‘span of operation’ of ‘jeevan’ is greater than its dimensions: its length, width & height.\nThe conscious-atom or ‘jeevan’ cannot be understood or identified by mathematics, or logic, since these are but some of the faculties in that very conscious-atom or jeevan itself.\nFor the conscious self: Only ‘it’ can know and understand ‘itself’, using faculties in ‘itself’. It also understands the entire existence and lives expressing ‘complete-humane-conduct’ in human tradition.\nEach one of us can verify this:\nOur desires and thoughts are ‘weightless’, our imagination is weightless, our dreams are weightless, and our ability to imagine is not dependent on the food we eat.\nWe have a sense of ‘being’, of being ‘aware’ and only ‘we’ can truly know ‘ourselves’. Each one of us has an innate need to know.\nEach one of us has an innate and natural need for ‘good’ and ‘well-being’ and ‘want’ to live ‘fulfilling lives’ – even though we may have assumed different ways of going about it.\n\nThe ‘construction’ of the conscious-unit (jeevan, chaitanya), its activities, capabilities, and need are the same in all Humans. Jeevan is the one that experiences pleasure-pain, happiness-unhappiness, feelings & emotions, reasons & analyzes, wants knowledge, and wants continuous happiness. Continuous Happiness = harmony in all the activities in Jeevan (conscious unit, or Self).\n\nIn the state of delusion (lack of knowledge) ‘jeevan’ assumes itself to be the body – Only partial faculties in ‘jeevan’ are active in this state (4.5 out of a total 10).\n\nThe conscious unit has the faculty or potential of cognition, The ‘conscious unit’ is not space. The conscious unit is endowed with consciousness by being saturated (soaked, submerged, and encircled) in space, hence space is also called ‘consciousness’.\n\n‘Jeevan’ or the conscious-unit has been identified as having 10 activities – 5 in state (stithi) and 5 in motion (gati). [every unit has state (stithi) and motion motion (gati) . state or stithi of a unit is its being in itself, while motion or gati is its expression in the larger order]. These 10 activities of the ‘self’ or ‘jeevan’ are inseparable from each other:\n\n10 Inseparable activities of the Conscious Unit (Self), or ‘Jeevan’ with the 5 ‘Powers’ and 5 ‘Forces’:\n\n* English-equivalent words in the table above are indicative only & to assist getting a sense of the activity. They are under revision. See Definitions for clarification on these activities. These activities will have to be understood retaining their original hindi nomenclature to ensure the meanings are not ‘mixed up’\n\nAtma (Soul)*: Is the name for the centre-particle of the conscious atom (‘jeevan’, Self). Its activity is Realization (Experience) of Coexistence and its Evidencing (Display). Evidencing is in the form of the force of ‘Evidence’ in expression, or the name of the activity of Evidencing is ‘Evidence’.\n\nBuddhi (Intellect): Is the name of the first orbit of the conscious atom (‘jeevan’, Self). Its activity is Comprehension and Determination. Determination is in the form of the force of ‘Truthfulness’ in expression, or the name of the activity of Determination is ‘Truthfulness’.\n\nChitta (Imager): Is the name of the second orbit of the conscious atom (‘jeevan’, Self). Its activity is Contemplation and Imaging. Imaging is in the form of the force of ‘Desiring’ in expression, or the name of the activity of Imaging is ‘Desiring’.\n\nVritti (Disposition) (Vritti literally means whirl, from pravritti?) Is the name of the third orbit of the conscious atom (‘jeevan’, Self). Its activity is Weighing and Analyzing. Weighing takes place on the basis of one of two sets of perspectives: “likes, health, profit” OR “justice, religion, truth” [religion: inseparability]. For the human living in animal-consciousness, only the perspectives of ‘likes, health, profit’ are active. Analyzing is in the form of the force of ‘Thought’ in expression, or the name of the activity of Analyzing is ‘Thought’.\n\nMun (Mind): Is the name of the fourth orbit of the conscious atom (‘jeevan’, Self). Its activity is Tasting/experiencing and Selecting. Selecting is in the form of the force of ‘Expectation’ in expression, or the name of the activity of Selecting is ‘Expectation’.\n\nThe conscious unit is saturated in space (consciousness) and hence has ‘consciousness’\n\nThe principle activities of a human being can thus be understood by the activities in jeevan. The rest is merely the physio-chemical activities of the body. Activities in jeevan include all familiar activities like “identity of Self or I”, of ‘existence’, tasting, selection, evaluation, thinking, memory, desiring, feeling, imagining, dreaming, curiosity, using logic, reason, intuition and yet unidentified activities which are detailed out in Madhyasth Darshan.\n\nAll these activities can be studied and known. I.e. it is possible to know one’s conscious self fully.\n\nUnawakened state: Living in Delusion, in animal-consciousness:\n\nAs of today, we ‘use’ or are ‘aware of’ or, are ‘awakened’ in only 4.5 of the above 10 activities.The remaining 5.5 activities still remain to be ‘known’ – or awakened.This is the basic cause for our unresolved condition, unanswered questions, our problems.\n\nThe human living with only 4.5 of 10 activities awakened in ‘jeevan’ is living in the purview of ‘animal-consciousness’. This is ‘delusion’ and the cause for illusion of ‘reality’ (incomplete/ wrong estimation of reality). The ‘view of reality’ while operating at this level of cognition is restricted to the dimensions of ‘form & properties’ and hence only ‘Assuming’.\n\nThe faculty of Knowing remains to be fulfilled. The only perspectives (drishti, or vision) active in ‘weighing’ are those of ‘likes, health & profit’. Our thinking, desiring, and goal of living remain confined to these aspects.\n\nThe dimensions of innate-nature, Religion & Truth is unknown; we only have the language & assumptions for these realities. Living at this level, there is no sound basis for the activity of Imaging (Desiring), and therefore, our Desires, Thoughts and Expectations keep changing, and we really don’t know anything in our own right. We are unable to be ‘stable’, we have contradictions within, and this itself is unhappiness.\n\nWe make wrong assumptions about human-human relationship and human-nature relationship and these manifest as the multitude of problems we have. It is not possible to understand Existence, Reality or any ‘grand-unifying-theory’ when operating from this level.\n\nAwakened state: Living with Knowledge, in human-consciousness:\n\nLiving with all 10 activities awakened is living in human-consciousness. This itself is ‘Resolution’ & happiness. Living with all 10 activities in conscious or ‘jeevan’ means having a) Knowledge of Jeevan (Self); b) Knowledge of realistic-view or darshan of Existence (Coexistence); and c) Knowledge of complete-Humane Conduct.\n\nThis means understanding and living with ‘Law, Restraint & Balance’ (niyam, niyantran, santulan) with the rest of the three ‘natural-orders’ and with Justice, Religion & Truth (nyaya, dharm, satya) with the Human Order.\n\nThis is only possible when we have knowledge of all four dimensions of reality: form, properties, innate-nature & religion of all the four ‘natural-orders’ for which ‘consciousness-development’ is needed.\n\nThus, one lives with knowledge of Actuality, Reality & the Truth and is ‘resolved’ and hence in harmony, is happy.\n\nOur imagination, which earlier had no basis of its own and was driven by assumptions, now functions according to the knowledge gained in the Orange shaded region, which itself is surety about the truth, confidence, happiness.\n\nTruth is understood as “Absolute Truth, Relative Truth and Objective Truth”.\n\n122 conducts in the awakened Self or Jeevan\n\nThe conscious unit (Self, or Jeevan, commonly referred to as ‘I’) has been found to be a “constitutionally-complete atom”. There are 61 particles in the conscious-atom (jeevan). Each of these particles has state (sthiti) and motion (gati). There is a conduct (behavior) for every state and every motion.\n\nThere are thus a total of 122 (61 x 2) activities / conducts in the fully awakened jeevan or conscious unit “Self”.\n\n64 activities in the fourth orbit: ‘mun’ or mind (32 in state, 32 in expression)\n36 activities in the third orbit: ‘vritti’ or disposition (16 in state, 16 state in expression)\n16 activities in the second orbit: ‘chitta’ (8 in state, 8 in expression)\n4 activities in the first orbit: ‘buddhi’ or intellect (2 in state, 2 in expression)\n2 activities in the centre: ‘atma’ or soul (1 in state, 1 in expression)\n\nEach of these activities has been identified, named and defined in Madhyasth Darshan.\n\nThe ‘degree of understanding’ (and hence its certainty) cognizable in ‘jeevan’ progressively increases from the fourth orbit, inwards until the centre. The reality ‘understood’ by the centre particle (atma) is the most (& complete), while this ‘understanding’ can be described in one line. As we move from the centre to the fourth orbit, the degree of understanding reduces, while the explanation, expression and words increase.\n\nThus, the understanding of the conscious-unit (jeevan)*, becomes the basis for:\n\nhuman knowledge, human psychology, sociology, economics, materialism, spiritualism, humanism, education, conduct, norms, systems, culture & civility and universal human constitution, since all these are desired by, understood by, carried by ‘jeevan’ or the conscious-unit, in human tradition. (* includes knowledge of darshan of coexistence, jeevan & humane-conduct)\n\nToday, (while living in animal consciousness) we only have the words and imaginations of the above conducts, activities and systems, do not have the meaning, the understanding, and hence do not live according to the above. With only 4.5 activities awakened, we have deformed versions of the conducts (behavior, realities) and systems given above.\n\nSnapshot of activities & 122 conducts in the awakened conscious-unit Jeevan or Self (constitutionally-complete atom) when living in human-consciousness\n\n[wpspoiler name=”122 activities in the awakened Self or Jeevan” ]\n\n* Words used in English are only indicative. Please see Original Hindi Literature for accuracy.\n\nPotential in Jeevan\t‘Location’ in jeevan atom\tBasic Activity\tCorresponding Conducts\n(in Awakened or jagrit jeevan)\nAtma\tCentre\t(know the) Property of indestructibility and active presence – (astitv – naash rahit gun)\t\n\nIn state: Realization (anubhav)\n\nThe complete acceptance obtained from existential-progression.\n\nConduct is: Eternal-presence in the form of Nature saturated in Omnipotence.

Units or matter are\n\n“saturated” (samprikt) in the all-pervasive-entity (vyaapak vastu), currently called space.\n\nTo be “saturated” means to be: (संप्रिक्त)\n\nSoaked (bheega): By which every unit is energized – oojrit (ऊर्जित)\nEncircled (ghira): By which every unit is restrained – niyantrit (नियंत्रित)\nSubmerged (dooba): By which every unit is active – kriyasheel (क्रियाशील)\n2. Void or ‘Space’ is:\nPervasive – vyaapak (व्यापक): there is no ‘place’ where space is not. Every ‘place’ itself is ‘space’.\nTransparent – pardarshi (पारदर्शी): Reflecting, every unit is able to recognize the other unit by being in it.\nPermeating – paargaami (पारगामी): Space exists ‘where’ there is a unit, units are so aked in space.\nOmnipotence – satta (सत्ता): Energy in equilibrium: that neither increases, nor decreases.\nHas no activity – kriyashunya (क्रियाशून्य): Inactive, not a ‘unit’, unchanging.\n\nWhat we call as ‘empty space’ is not ‘empty’; it is equilibrium energy itself and the fundamental source for all activity (at the atomic level) in the entire universe, in existence.\n\nSpace manifests as ‘energy’ in physiochemical matter (jad) and as ‘knowledge (gyaan)’ or ‘consciousness (chetana)’ in the conscious unit (chaitanya) (Self or Jeevan).\n\n‘Units’ (Ikai) are of two kinds:\n\n(Units = Nature, Matter, Mass, Substance, Material)\n\nPhysiochemical (insentient) (Jad)\nConscious (sentient) (Chaitanya)\n\nThese units, or ‘Nature’ is manifested as the 4 ‘natural-orders’:\n\nKnowledge Order (human beings) – ज्ञान व्यवस्था\nAnimal Order – जीव व्यवस्था\nBio (pranic) Order – प्राण व्यवस्था\nMaterial Order – पदार्थ व्यवस्था\n\nEach unit in Existence, i.e. each of the four ‘natural-orders’ has the following dimensions:\n\nForm/appearance (Shape, Surface Area, Density) – रूप\nProperties (Positive, Negative, Mediating properties; relative cause and effect) – गुण\nInnate-nature (Purpose or participation or value or essence) – स्वभाव\nReligion (Inseparability or Innateness) – धर्म\n\nEvery ‘unit’ (from an atom to the larger formations of matter) in existence has these four dimensions. Of these four dimensions, ‘form/appearance’ and ‘properties’ are ‘form-full’ in that they have length, breadth & height while innate-nature & religion are form-less (no length, breadth, height). Understanding both the form-full and form-less dimensions is needed to understand these 4 ‘natural-orders’ completely, to understand reality.\n\nThis enables us to understand their ‘innate-nature’ as their ‘purpose’ in existence, their participation or their value; and their religion, as their very ‘being-ness’ or ‘intrinsic-ness’, or their ‘orderliness within’.\n\nTo date, humankind has largely concerned itself with the study of only the form-full dimensions’ of reality (form/appearance and properties) ignoring the other dimensions of reality.\n\nThe following dimensions of reality still remain to be understood by us humans:\nAll-pervasive-entity (omnipresence) or space, and its attributes of\nOmnipotence, permeating, & Transparency\nव्यापक तत्व, व्यापकत्व, सत्ता, पारदर्शी, व्यापकत्व\nConscious unit or matter that has consciousness (Chaitanya Ikai), and its dimensions:\nform/appearance\nproperties\ninnate-nature\nreligion\nThe 3 formless aspects of physiochemical units/matter (Jad Upadān):\nMediating Properties\nInnate-nature & Religion (माध्यम गुण, स्वभाव और धर्म)\nRelationship between the above:\nconscious matter, physiochemical matter and all-expansive omnipotence (space): चैतन्य इकाई, जड़ इकाई, व्यापक सत्ता में संबंध\n\nThe problems we have today are a result of not having the above knowledge. The reason we do not have this knowledge is because we have not yet ‘used’ certain faculties of knowing present in ourselves (Self or jeevan).\n\nMadhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya) has proposals for the above, in the form of words that point to these realities. On Studying these realities with the aid of words, and using the ‘faculty’ of imagination present in us under the guidance of someone who has this knowledge, we are able to have ‘understanding’ of these realities in our own right.\n\nThe atom is the smallest basic unit that is in organization or orderliness in Existence:\n\nThe smallest unit to count as ‘1’ is the atom – this is the ‘stable point’ for counting, below which we do not find any definiteness. The natural state of being of ‘matter’ is in the form of an atom. This atom is natural to existence. The human being does not ‘organize’ the atom, or ‘regulate’ them; nor are we ‘supplying’ energy to atoms for them to be continuously active; and neither have we created the various types of atoms.\n\nWe can only study and comprehend stable states – and our study has to include the ‘whole’ [units and space] and ‘the observer’ [the conscious entity that is understanding].\n\nThere is no centralization in Existence. There is no ‘creator, sustainer, controller and destroyer’. There is decentralized self-regulation in Existence.\n\nThis ‘orderliness’ is seen across all 4 ‘natural-orders’, and except in the human, on this planet.\n\nUnits in Existence are self-organized, or in ‘orderliness within’ and participate in the larger orderliness. No one is ‘organizing’ this from the outside. This is their natural state of being.\n\n* Innate Nature & Religion\nInnate-Nature (Swabhav)\nInnate-nature of the material-order is ‘composition-decomposition’\nInnate-nature of the bio-order is ‘enhance-worsen’\nInnate-nature of the animal-order is cruel — non-cruel\nInnate-nature of humans living in ‘animal-consciousness’ is: wretchedness, cunningness & cruelness\nInnate-nature of humans living in ‘human-consciousness’ (true human nature) is: steadfastness, courage & generosity, kindness, graciousness & compassion\nReligion (Dharma)\nReligion of the material-order is: to exist, indestructibly\nReligion of the bio-order (plants, pranic) is: ‘growth’\nReligion of the animal-order is: ‘the will to live’\nReligion of the human-order is: live with happiness, resolution\n\n#origin of the word ‘religion’: based on Latin religare ‘to bind’\n\nMan living in animal-consciousness uses only partial activities in the Self or conscious unit (jeevan), and as a result lives with animal-like attributes. He lives only with Assuming (& expectation of Knowing) & innate-nature as wretchedness, cunningness, cruelty: which is unnatural to him, and is not acceptable to him, or to others (when expressed). He has an expectation for resolution & happiness (his religion) but is unable to have/ensure continuity of the same.\n\nMan living in this state, makes some assumptions regarding his innate-nature & religion that do not have universality and thus cause differences in human-society. This is why this plane of living is called ‘animal-consciousness’ since even though man has progressed from where animals are, he has still not known his innate-nature & religion, still not accessed the will to ‘know’ and hence, assumes struggle for survival as the goal (akin to animals) and an innate-nature that is akin to animals.\n\nThe proof of this is the definition of the Human as a ‘social-animal’.\n\nMan living in human-consciousness lives well all 10 activities in the Self or conscious unit (jeevan), and as a result lives with the humane-attributes. He lives with Knowledge (& Assuming, Recognition and Fulfillment on this basis) & his innate-nature is steadfastness, courage & generosity: which is natural to him, and acceptable to him, and to others (when expressed).\n\nI.e. the rest of the 3 ‘natural-orders’ are living according to their innate-nature & religion. Only man needs to do so. He is able to do so by having ‘knowledge’. Man has thus been recognized as belonging to the ‘knowledge-order’. Knowledge is his fundamental need. Thus, on the basis of living with human-consciousness, it becomes clear that:\n\nHuman Nature is the SAME for all humans (on the basis of their ‘innate-nature’),\nHuman Race is ONE (based on similar construction of the Body &)\nHuman Religion is ONE (based on happiness, resolution, understanding)\n\n[Innate-nature = purpose, value] [Religion = inseparability; that which cannot be separated from a unit is its religion, same as dharma]\n\nThus, the fundamental need for the human is to SHIFT from living in animal-consciousness to living in human-consciousness, which is only possible via Knowledge with the method of consciousness development.\n\nImportant Definitions of Words used in Knowledge of Darshan of Existence\nTerm (Sanskrit)\tEnglish Meaning\tExplanation\nसत्ता (satta)\tOmnipotence\tThe eternal grandeur present in all places where nature is, and where nature is not. Space is permeable in conscious and physiochemical nature and is transparent in their mutualities. That which is not an activity itself, but in which all activities are included (activities are present in space). They are soaked, submerged & encircled in space. What we consider to be ‘empty space’ or void is actually an all-pervasive-entity, a reality. It is Omnipotence = energy in equilibrium.\nस्तु (vyapak)\tPervasive-entity (Omnipresence)\tThat which is cognizable via the activity of realization in the Self, or conscious unit (jeevan). Origin of the word entity: 15th century (denoting a thing’s existence): from French entité or medieval Latin entitas, from Latin ens, ent-‘being’ (from esse ‘be’).\nशून्य (shunya)\tSpace, Void\tSpace, absolute-force, equilibrium energy, in which all units exist. Recognized as void but actually is all-pervasive-entity.\nचेतना (chetana)\tConsciousness\tCognition, accomplished with knowledge, wisdom & science. Knowledge, equilibrium energy, space, absolute-force.\nरूप (roop)\tForm/appearance\tShape, surface area and volume.\nगुण (guna)\tProperties\tRelative powers are known as properties (guna). Properties (gunas) are recognized in the form of positive, negative, and madhyasth (mediating), which itself is effect. Synonyms: quality, especially when we consider ‘properties’ of a human being.\nस्वभाव (swabhav)\tInnate-nature\tPurpose, participation, value. The utility of properties itself is innate-nature. Synonyms: essence, true-nature, characteristic, fundamental attribute.\nधर्म (dharma)\tReligion\tInseparability itself is dharma. That which cannot be separated from a unit is its dharma or religion. Translator notes: inseparability, innateness origin of the word ‘religion’: based on Latin religare ‘to bind’.\nअस्तित्व (astitv)\tExistence\tPhysiochemical and conscious nature saturated in all-pervasive-entity, in Omnipotence (space).\nसह अस्तित्व (sah-astitv)\tCoexistence\t(Definition in the context of existential-purpose of humankind): Relationships without exploitation, hoarding and hatred, and fulfillment of relationships and associations with behavior of generosity, affection, and serving alone is co-existence.

This knowledge is:\n\nKnowledge of realistic-view of Existence: [अस्तित्व दर्शन ज्ञान]\nExistence is Coexistence, as nature saturated in all-pervasive 'space/energy'. Nature = collection of active units = physicochemical and conscious units.\nKnowledge of all four dimensions of nature (matter): form, properties, innate-nature & religion (rup, gun, swabhāv & dharm) consisting of formful and formless dimensions.\nKnowledge of Conscious Self (Jeevan): [जीवन् ज्ञान]\nKnowledge of the 10 activities in the Self (Conscious) and the 5 Potentials and 5 Forces.\nViz: Tasting & Choosing; Evaluating & Analysing; Contemplating & Visualising; Comprehension & Determination; Realization & Evidencing corresponding respectively to the 5 factors: disposition, mind, intellect & soul (mun, vritti, citta, buddhi & ātmā).\nKnowledge of perfect-Humane Conduct: (मानवीय आचरण ज्ञान)\nLiving in human-human relationships and human-nature relationships - as humane values, character & ethics.\nWisdom (viveka)\n\nWhile knowledge enables understanding of what exists, and how it exists, Wisdom based on knowledge provides the purpose for human living:\n\nWisdom or Conscience based on Knowledge is defined as knowledge of the:\n\nimmortality of the conscious self (jeevan) & mortality of the body – hence enables discrimination between ‘true & false’\nknowledge of the laws of living as intellectual law, social law and natural law – hence enables discrimination between ‘right & wrong’\n\nOn the basis of the above identification, wisdom enables the identification of the Universal Human Goal in the form of:\n\nResolution (samadhaan) in every Individual\n(leading to happiness) [हर व्यक्ति में समाधान]\nProsperity in every Family\n(leading to happiness, peace) [हर परिवार में समृद्धि]\nFearlessness (Trust) in Society\n(leading to happiness, peace, satisfaction) [समाज में अभय]\nCoexistence in all four ‘natural-orders’\n(leading to happiness, peace, satisfaction + bliss) [प्रकृति में सह-अस्तित्व]\n\n\nScience (vigyan)\nTHE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC OUTCOME:\n\nHumans want to succeed in the method of science. Science so far has faced the following two experimental & behavioral difficulties in being able to succeed:\n\nFirstly, could not find out any clue about the ultimate truth,\nSecondly, could not find out the basic unit, basic energy & their goal\n\nScience’s attempt to recognize the human as being equivalent to a machine and has been entirely unsuccessful.\n\nThe scientific view is committed to struggle. On this basis, it is postulated that entire nature other than humans is for human consumption. People and technology based on science have ended up trying to dominate nature. This is at the root of our ecological crisis. Will science take responsibility for this outcome? Which scientist is even ready to assume this responsibility? (for natural destruction). Who is responsible for science?\n\nThe book or the human?\n\nInstruments which are an outcome of such books are assumed to be the basis for the ultimate truth. In this manner, rather than humans taking up responsibility, this responsibility has been imposed on the instrument. This was so we could escape getting embroiled in logic. An instrument cannot be argued with, since a machine/instrument keeps repeating the results. In this manner, reiterating repeatedly was assumed to be the basis for trust. On the basis of scientific endeavor, Humans thus moved away from assuming responsibility for their actions (extrapolating it on the machine). Whereas, we find on scrutiny and observation that every human is in favor of assuming responsibility. Every human is in favor of justice, is in favor of order. At the base of all of this, every human is in favor of being wise.\n\nFrom the co-existential view, we can thus see that while knowledge enables understanding of what exists, & wisdom provides the purpose & goal, science determines how to achieve these goals – the direction for achieving the universal human-goal. Science consists of :\n\nKnowledge of Activity or procedural knowledge\n\n(Activity is continuous, eternal-active-presence; never ceases since units are energized by being in space)\n\nKnowledge of Time or chronological knowledge\n\n(As Past, Presence & Future: The Periodicity of an activity itself is measured-time)\n\nKnowledge of Decision or purposeful knowledge\n\n(provides the direction to achieve the Human Goal identified via Wisdom – viveka)\n\nCoexistential Science thus consists of :\nMaterial Science – study & implementation of physical-chemical interactions & procedures\nBehavioral science – study of & implementation of human interactions & ways of living\nSpiritual science – study & practice of conscious (psychological) interactions & procedures for knowledge\n\nThe study of physiochemical nature and the use of technology, is thus for a definite purpose: to fulfill the universal human goal, and these are in keeping in mind the inherent coexistence & harmony in nature.\n\nScience in the co-existential view, is thus not in opposition with nature, nor is it alienated from human purpose and life.\n\nThis is the meaning of wisdom-oriented science, or science with purpose.\n\nIn the coexistent view, there is absolutely no entity or reality in existence that cannot be understood. Everything ‘in’ existence, in reality has been understood. And this can be communicated and can be lived.\n\nshriram n | student | jan 2012, updated jan 2015"

    "content": "Home\nPhilosophy\nExplore Concepts\nKnowledge Of Humane Conduct\nPhilosophy\nIn Brief\nOrigins\nKey Discoveries\nLiterature\nExplore Concepts\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nKnowledge of Humane conduct\n\n(विवेक, मानवीयतपूर्ण आचरण ज्ञान)\n\nHaving understood Existence and the nature of the Conscious unit, or Self (Jeevan), we understand our relationship with every unit in Existence & live accordingly, in the form of complete-Human Conduct, via Wisdom (vivek).\n\nWhen a human being has knowledge, he desires, thinks and behaves according to that knowledge. This knowledge is based on existence, on reality; hence human living becomes based on a definite meaning and understanding, leading to a definite human conduct. On the basis of this knowledge, the human is able to clearly identify the ‘values in living‘ as his ‘participation in the larger orderliness’.\n\nHe is able to see that these values are naturally acceptable to him; and living according to these values gives him satisfaction and is also fulfilling for other humans and the rest of nature (plants, animals, etc). ‘Values’ are thus the same as our ‘participation’ or ‘innate-nature’; our ‘purpose’ of living.\n\nConsequently, all his thoughts and imagination become in accordance with these ‘values’ and he expresses his understanding via these ‘values’ with other humans as well as nature. Therefore to live with these values becomes natural for him and to live otherwise becomes unnatural.\n\nOn the basis of this he is able to live with satisfaction in the self and have mutually satisfying relationships: with other humans and with ‘nature’. This itself is ‘justice’ & fulfillment in relationships.\n\nThis prepares the ground for Human tradition via education. Human beings can thus have definite conduct. Complete-Humane Conduct comprises of:\n\nValues [मूल्य]\nCharacter [चरित्र]\nEthics [निति]\n\nFirst – values are our participation in the larger orderliness. There are 4 values in the Self, or Jeevan, 6 Human Values, 18 Values in Human-Human relationship and 2 Values in Human-Nature relationship; totaling 30 values in all. Put together, these are ‘human values’.\n\nSecond – humane-character is the same for every human. Humane-character is in the form of righteous-wealth, morality in husband-wife relationship and work-behavior filled with kindness. [चरित्र = स्वधन, स्वनरी/स्वपुरुष, दया पूर्ण कार्य व्यवहार]\n\nThird – we realize ethics when we rightly-use and protect our resources (body, mind, and wealth). [तुन, मन, धन का सुरक्षा, सदुपयोग]\n\nIn this way, complete- humane-conduct gets explained as a combination of values, character, and ethics. These are the three pillars for our living in orderliness\n\nLiving with such humane-conduct requires the basis of Wisdom:\n\nWisdom, Conduct and Values do not need to be ‘enforced’, or ‘learnt’. They are a natural outcome of Knowledge, of Understanding. Each Human has Natural Acceptance for these laws and values.\n\nWisdom, Universal Human Laws of Living\n\nImmortality of Jeevan, Perishable nature of the body, and Laws of living:\n\nIntellectual Laws (pertaining to Self):Non-Accumulation (Balance between spends and earnings: prosperity), Affection, Knowledge, Ease, Fearlessness\nSocial Laws (pertaining to Human-Human relationship, in Society):Righteous Wealth, Righteous Marital relationship (Husband/Wife), Kindness in work and behavior\nNatural Laws (pertaining to Human - rest of Nature relationship):Utility, Complementarity, Purpose-fullness, Coexistence\nThe 30 Values (human values) of Humane-Conduct when living with such wisdom:\nValues: [मूल्य]\n\n4 ‘Values in the Self’ (Conscious unit, Jeevan): Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction, Bliss.\n\n6 ‘Human Values’: Steadfastness, Courage, Generosity and Kindness, Graciousness, Compassion\n\n18 ‘Relationship Values’: Values in Human-Relationships (Interpersonal)\n\nHuman Relationship IS in existence. It does not have to be created. It is already there. It only needs to be understood. These are definite expectations in relationships, also called values. Values in behavior are manifest in human relationships as 9 established and 9 expression values. These are definite and can be understood. i.e. the expectations in human relationships are definite and can be fulfilled leading to mutual satisfaction.\n\nThe identification of Human Relationships, fulfillment of values and mutual satisfaction itself is Justice.\n\n#\tEstablished-Value (स्थापित मूल्य)\tExpressed-Values (सिद्ध मूल्य)\n1\tTrust (विश्वास)\tComplementariness (पूरकता)\n2\tRespect (सम्मान)\tCompliance (सहिष्णुता)\n3\tAffection (स्नेह)\tCommitment (निष्ठा)\n4\tCare (ममता)\tGenerosity (उदारता)\n5\tGuidance (मार्गदर्शन)\tSpontaneity (स्वाभाविकता)\n6\tReverence (श्रद्धा)\tObedience (आज्ञापालन)\n7\tGlory (गौरव)\tEase (सहजता)\n8\tGratitude (कृतज्ञता)\tSelf-restraint (संयम)\n9\tLove (प्रेम)\tUnanimity (अभिन्नता)\nThere are 7 kinds of Human-Relationships in line with Human Purpose:\nName of Relationship\tActivity, Purpose\nFather-Mother, Son-Daughter\tNourishment, Protection; Utility – Complementariness\nHusband-Wife\tMutual Complementariness\nBrother-Sister\tMutual Assistance\nFriend-Friend\tMutual Assistance\nTeacher-Student\tEvidenced-Enquiring\nColleague-Coworker\tResponsibility-Duty\nSystem Relation\tParticipation\n\nValues flow only on recognizing the meaning or purpose of relationships. For example – when someone recognizes the meaning or purpose of relation of his father, or of the teacher, then values naturally flow in those relationships. When the mother recognizes the relationship with the child, she does not need to make efforts to have the feeling of Care, it flows naturally.\n\nValues don’t flow naturally where there isn’t any recognition of relationships. Study of relations can be done on the basis of their purposes. The continuity of recognition of relationships and fulfillment of values is only possible by having knowledge, by living in developed-consciousness, as human-consciousness.\n\nEach of the 7 relationships and the 18 values therein are explained in detail in the Madhyasth Darshan–Coexistentialism literature.\n\nCharacter: [चरित्र]\n\nLiving with acceptance for ‘social laws’ itself manifests as ‘character’ while living in human-society.\n\nRighteous Wealth:\n\nWealth acquired by means of:\n\n(a) Fruit of efforts employed on nature\n(b) Gift from someone\n(c) Award given (without asking or expectation) for services rendered in society\nRighteous Marital relationship (Husband/Wife):\nFidelity in Marital relationship: in Words, Thought & Deeds\nKindness in Work and behavior:\nNot intruding in the others progress. Recognition of complementariness.\n\nLiving with these social-laws or ‘character’ ensures we are self-restrained, not intruding in the other persons living in society, we let the other live. When we are unable to live with the above, we end up being a burden for society. All crimes in society are a result of not following one, some or all of the above:\n\nUnrighteous Wealth: Steal, Cheat or Conniving, Harming someone’s wealth.\nInfidelity: Causing mental and physical harm by outraging someone’s modesty.\nSadism: Either speak, wish or partake in acts to cause harm to the other: mentally or physically.\nEthics [निति]\n\nEssence of Ethics is deploying one’s resources (body, mind, and wealth) for purposefulness. This is called right-use. Right-use is in two aspects:\n\nReligious Ethics (Ethics of Religion, Dharma)\nRight-use of one’s resources: Body, Mind (conscious aspect), and Wealth.\nState Ethics (Ethics of State, Rajya)\nProtection of one’s resources: Body, Mind (conscious aspect), and Wealth.\n\n* Living in this manner/on this basis flows naturally from every human as a result of knowledge. It does not have to be imposed from outside or ‘learnt’ and ‘repeated’. Hence, this is not a ‘set of beliefs’ or a ‘set of rules’ to be followed, but something that has to be known. This is the reason ‘human values’ is only possible via consciousness-development.\n\nIn this way, complete-Humane-conduct gets defined as a combined form of Values, Character, and Ethics.\n\nHuman Family\nThe family is the basic unit of organization and basis for humane society:\n\nSuch a family consists of a definite set of individuals living with ‘resolution,’ & prosperity. They participate in production, exchange of goods and ensuring ‘justice’ – by way of living with ‘humane conduct’ as defined above. A family unit typically consists of 3 generations and about 10-12 people. Recognition of relationship and fulfillment of values such as Trust, Respect, Affection and Care in the family ensures mutual-fulfillment which itself is Justice.\n\nThere are 3 relationships within the family: Mother-Father/Son-Daughter; Husband-Wife; and Brother-Sister.There are 3 relationships outside the family: Friend-Friend; Colleague-Coworker; and the ‘System’ relation(participation in human orderliness, systems). Every human lives in such relationships, even today. When we deny any of these relationships, it causes problems.\n\nThe identity of a human being is only in the family. A human being has no independent identity (although we imagine otherwise today). Material needs can only be definitely identified in a family.\n\nJust like many particles come together to form an atom which is the smallest unit in orderliness in the Universe, so also, humans come together to live in a family (some by birth, some by marriage) and this forms the smallest unit and basis for orderliness in human society. Human beings experience fulfillment only by living in relationships.\n\nIt is not possible to have complete-Humane-Conduct without Wisdom; and it is not possible to have Wisdom without ‘Knowledge’.\n\n– shriram n | student | jan 2012"

An awakened human society fulfills the Human aim of Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction & Bliss.\n\nThere are thus two kinds of programs for us:\nA Program to ensure understanding or Knowledge in the conscious Self – leading to Resolution\nA program to ensure requirements of the Body – leading to Prosperity.\n\nPut together, these fulfill the Universal Human Goal of\n\nIntellectual Resolution in every Human\nMaterial Prosperity in every Family\nFearlessness in Society – leading to an Undivided Society\nCoexistence with Nature – leading to Universal Order\n\nThe program to fulfill the above Goals are in the following 5 dimensions, for which a committee needs to be formed in every village. Every family is assumed to consist of 10 members and a family shall spare one member to participate in the village organization. Every village shall consist of 100 such families, and will thus have a 10 member “village organization council”. This council shall then form 5 committees to address the following five dimensions:\n\nEducation & right values or sanskar Committee\nHealth & Discipline Committee\nProduction & Work Committee\nExchange & Storage Committee\nJustice & Security Committee\nA brief elaboration is provided below:\n1. Education & right values or sanskar Committee\n\nThis is the primary program for Humans. The human is a combined form of the conscious self or jeevan and the physical-chemical body. The basic need of the conscious jeevan is knowledge or understanding, by which it becomes fulfilled: has happiness, peace, satisfaction, etc. The primary purpose of Education is to thus enable this need.\n\nThis is called Humane Education and is possible via Consciousness Development via Human Values (CVMS). Our entire education will have to be re-established in this light. Our way of looking at ourselves, at reality, and our program has to be re-looked at. This committee shall look into these aspects:\n\nThis is in contrast to current day Education where the aims vary from place to place, from country to country. There have been two kinds of Education in human history to date:\n\nReligious Education, which seeked to further Religious aims and dictats\nMaterialist Education: which seeks to establish a proven understanding of Material Reality and the ability to acquire it in later life\n\n‘Coexistentialist Education’ means to understand all aspects of Existence, Human Being, and Human Living on this basis.\n\n2. Health & Discipline Committee\n\nThe Body is needed for the conscious jeevan to acquire knowledge and also express this understanding in Human Living: in family, society, etc. Humans did not make the human body. We did not make ourselves. We have come to be. The human body is a fine balance of many many vital organs that work together to function as a synergistic whole. All the organs work together in a fine rhythm so the 5 senses (sight, touch, sound, smell & taste) and 5 motor organs (hands, feet, urination, excretion & swallowing) function smoothly.\n\nThe role of discipline is to understand what is suitable for the Human Body and ensure this. It is the responsibility of conscious jeevan to do this. Health is a result of this discipline and nutrition & exercise. To be healthy means the 5 sense organs and 5 motor organs are functioning as per the needs of jeevan. This committee shall look into these aspects.\n\nToday, we see that we try and get satisfaction from the Body. Since our need for happiness is continuous, the things we do with the body, on the body in order to derive sensory pleasure is also seemingly endless, due to which the Body becomes abused. Hence, it is only with discipline that Health can be ensured.\n\n3. Production & Work Committee\n\nThe Body needs material input. Human endeavor needs material input. The efforts we apply on the rest of nature to get material things is called Work. Production is a result of work. On understanding Coexistence, work follows the approach below:\n\nWe produce as much as is needed to fulfill and exceed the material requirements of the Family. Since the need of the Body is limited, production is also definable and becomes limited.\nThe method of production follows the inherent laws of cyclicity in Nature – human production thus not only sustains Nature, but can also enrich it.\n\nThis in contrast to our current approach where production is unlimited, even behaving with people is considered work, and most of our reliance on energy and production techniques, not to mention consumption patterns are steadily eroding Nature.\n\n4. Exchange & Storage Committee\n\nNot everyone produces everything. We don’t produce all year round. We thus store the excess production for future use and Exchange the excess with others for goods that we may need in return. We are able to do this with the right understanding. This means we have understood Justice, Religion & Truth. The perspectives of Liking, Health & Profit become restrained under the influence of such understanding. We are thus able to partake in profit-less Exchange and do not engage in hoarding out of fear, greed, etc.\n\nOur exchange mechanisms today are profit-centric. They assume that profit will lead to goods, which shall lead to happiness. They also assume that a few people profiting will benefit the larger society. The problem with this is there is no end-point of satisfaction when it comes to profit, since there will always be a mathematical number in profit that will be greater than what we have. This leads to hoarding of wealth. This whole notion needs to be re-looked at, since it is not serving human purpose.\n\n5. Justice & Security Committee\n\nJustice means the code of conduct to ensure the protection of humanness. Justice can only be understood on understanding human relationship, which itself can only be understood on understanding the human being and the nature of reality that connects two humans. The satisfaction point of human relationship itself is Justice. This is achieved by recognizing relationships as they are a part of Human Order, fulfillment of the values and mutual fulfillment of both humans involved.\n\nWhen we rightly-utilize a thing, it automatically becomes secured. In this way, we are able to ensure the security of mind, body and wealth by right-utilization.\n\nToday, we pass judgements in the name of justice. We talk of justice only in response to a wrong that has been done. We don’t understand what Justice is, in itself. Retribution and punishment depends on fear as a deterrent. It doesn’t teach right understanding. As a result, our crimes never seem to stop. Such use of force and power itself gives rise to struggles and uprising, which causes a Security problem.\n\nIndividuals, societies and Nations, in their endless quest for power, influence and wealth routinely transgress onto others’ boundaries, further exacerbating the problem. The basic reason for this is that the continuous needs of the conscious jeevan cannot be fulfilled by the finite material world. The faculties in the jeevan are inexhaustible. They can only be fulfilled by knowledge. If we understand this, our problems in Justice and Security sort themselves out.\n\n10-staged Family based World Organization\n\nThese 5 dimensions of the Human Program can be carried out in 10 stages: starting from a single family at the first stage, to the entire world at the 10th stage. Each family elects a representative for coordinating with at the societal level, and 10 such members then go onto form a committee connecting to the next village or town.\n\nThus, at the first (1st) level, around 10 people in a family (called “Family Organisation”) are engaged in activities related to resolution and prosperity meeting their partial needs through own production.\n\nAt the second (2nd) level, 10 such families (called “Neighbour Family Organisation”) organised together and participating in 5 dimensional program are able to meet all basic requirement and some additional requirements of all 10 families. Each family with consent of all 10 members (called “Family Assembly”) spares a member for coordinating the activities of these 10 families in addition to carrying activities in family as agreed by all members of the family. These 10 members spared from 10 families make a “Neighbour Family Assembly”.\n\nThe same sequence of each level electing 1 member, and 10 such members forming a committee of governance or order is then continued at the level of the Village, County, Block, District, Group of Districts, State, Nation and Inter-Nation, thus connecting all the way to the entire World in 10 stages.\n\nThus based on this understanding, we have the relationship from Family to World Family and systems for human functioning from Family Order to World Family Order."

It has its own independent standing on reality.\n•\nDefinitions of the keywords used in this presentation are provided on this website. Please read this write-up along with these definitions.\nPreface\n* PDF download here\n\nMy fellow human brothers and sisters,\n\nThe Study of Human-being could not be accomplished until now by the two major ideologies – Theism-Idealism and Materialism (Science) – that emerged and evolved in the history of humankind. I experienced happiness while informing you that – The Alternative is \"Madhyasth Darshan Saha-Astitva-Vad\" for which another name is \"Existence-Rooted Human-Centric Contemplation\". The Study of Human-being is now possible, in fact, and for coexistence with Madhyasth Darshan.\n\nThe Alternative here is an attempt to make you aware that all scrutiny, examination, and survey exercises have been completed for universalizing the study of human-being through the method of value-education based on consciousness-development. One such place is “Abhyudaya Sansthan” in Chattisgarh, India.\n\nThis presentation also elucidates how all resolved-humans can live with justice; how every resolved-family can live with resolution and prosperity; and how justice, resolution, and prosperity can be universalized in humankind through the method of education. I trust you will internalize the presented information – using your own good rationale.\n\nYours,\n\nA. Nagraj\n\nOriginator – Madhyasth Darshan Saha-Astitva-Vad,\n\nDivya Path Sansthan,\n\nBhajanashram, Amarkantak,\n\nDistt Anuppur, M.P.\n\nINDIA\n\nThe Background\n\nThe study of human-being could not be achieved by the method of instability, uncertainty rooted physical-chemical material centric ideology or Science. The study of human-being could also not be achieved by the method of mystery rooted idealistic contemplation. In both these types of ideologies, human-being has been called a kind of animal (jeev).\n\nIn the form of an alternative, via the method of existence-rooted human-centered contemplation, Madhyasth-Darshan Sah-astitva-vad recognized and helped others recognize the human-being as belonging to the knowledge-order.\n\nAccording to Madhyasth-Darshan, human-being alone is the knower in existence (one who knows), existence in the form of coexistence is the reality worth knowing, in other words, is the entire reality to be known, this itself is knowledge of darshan or realistic-view. Along with this, the method for evidencing coexistence with knowledge of jeevan and complete-humane conduct has now become study-able.\n\nThe knowledge of existence rooted human-centric contemplation, Madhyasth Darshan, Sah-astitva-vad has been presented for study in literature-form by me before humankind.\n\nPrior to existence-rooted human-centric contemplation, I (A. Nagraj, Agrahar Nagraj, Hassan district, Karnataka State, India) was initiated in spiritual-knowledge vedic-ideology based worships and actions.\n\n(* A Nagraj was born on 14 January, 1920)\n\nAccording to Vedantic-knowledge “Brahman is Real, World is Illusion” – whereas the origin of the material and conscious world has been said to have been from Brahman.\n\nWorship (upasana) :- in the context of deities\n\nAction (karma) :- All actions for attaining “heaven” (in language form)\n\nIn the Manu Dharma Shastra :- Prescribes code of daily conduct of four social-classes (varna) in four life-stages (ashrama).\n\nRituals :- From conception till death, sixteen types of ritual-services are believed and their activities are prescribed.\n\nFrom the study of all these, there arose a question in my mind:\n\nHow could the conscious and material world that originated from the “ultimate-truth, knowledge, infinite Brahman” be an illusion? Upon taking this inquiry to the vedic-scholars and other renowned wise people of that time: –\n\nI got the assurance that ‘the unknown becomes known’ in the state of samadhi. On the basis of its confirmation in the scriptures, I accepted to perform the necessary activities for sadhana, samadhi and sanyam. In the state sanyam, via the method of study and realization, I obtained the complete-understanding of entire existence being and manifesting as coexistence, as a result of which Madhyasth Darshan, Sah-Astitva-vaad arose in literature form as an alternative.\n\nAccording to scriptures of idealism and mystery-rooted, God-centered contemplation and tradition – “Knowledge is unmanifest and is incommunicable.”\n\nAccording to Madhyasth-Darshan – Knowledge is manifest, communicable and knowable via the method of study, and it became clear that its evidence is universally achievable through human-behaviour.\n\nIn material centered ideology according to instability, indefiniteness-rooted materialism, science is believed to be knowledge, in which it is said that man hypothesizes the laws of nature. As its alternative, according to coexistentialist ‘existence rooted human-centeric contemplation’; it has been postulated that existence is stable, progress and awakening are definite, and all laws are natural in state and manifestation.\n\nThe nature of existence is not just physiochemical, but all physical, chemical, and conscious (jeevan) entities are inseparably present in the all-pervasive-entity (Omnipresence). This itself is the essence of Madhyasth Darshan, Sah-astitva-vad.\n\nContinue Reading...

The conscious unit or ‘self’ or ‘jeevan’ has 10 activities in combinations of 2 each: one in potential, and the other in expression as ‘force’: experience-evidencing; understanding-determination; contemplation-imaging; weighing-analysis and tasting-selecting. Clarification: conscious unit is an activity; it is a 'constitutionally-completed atom'. It is not ‘material’ in the sense it has the faculty or potential of cognition, but it is a reality, a unit, made up of the same sub-atomic particles as material units. The ‘conscious unit’ is not space. The conscious unit is endowed with consciousness by being saturated in space; hence space is also called ‘consciousness’.\nप्रकृति (prakriti)\tNature\tForm-full existence; i.e., Infinite units of material-order, bio-order, animal-order and knowledge-order (humans).

The utility of properties itself is innate-nature. # Synonyms: essence, true-nature, characteristic, fundamental attribute. Innate-nature of the material-order is ‘composition-decomposition’; of the bio-order is ‘enhance-worsen’; of the animal-order is cruel.

English version by Shriram N | student | January 2015\n\nOmnipotence (space) is Mediating (madhyasth*), it is all-pervasive. Nature in Omnipotence is as attractive, repulsive, and mediating (madhyasth) activities and is limited. Therefore Omnipotence is in the complete(perfect)-state.\n\nMaterial and conscious nature in Omnipotence (space) is continuously-evolving therefore nature is contained in the Omnipotence (space). Therefore, Nature is totally inundated in the Omnipotence (space). As nature is saturated in the Omnipotence (space), therefore, nature is fully-energized. In other words nature is continuously-evolving. Therefore, nature continuously manifests effort, motion, and constitution. As a result, nature itself is perceivable in four natural-orders. For this reason, out of the physio-chemical and conscious nature saturated in Omnipotence, the opportunities for conscious nature for attaining the potential, ability, and receptivity for realization are always close, and the four natural-orders are completely bound amongst each other for wholeness.\n\nOmnipotence (space) is Mediating (madhyasth). Therefore, nature saturated in Mediating (madhyasth) Omnipotence is restrained and protected. The central-part (nucleus) found in every atom is the Mediating (madhyasth)-activity. Therefore, attractive and repulsive activities and relative forces (in every atom) are restrained and protected.\n\nInfinite activities or groups of activities itself is nature, which is recognizable as physiochemical (jad) and conscious (chaitanya). Physiochemical nature itself attains the conscious-plane after development-completeness. This is by way of existential destiny. Human-being is a combined form of physiochemical and conscious, and at the same time is also a part of nature.\n\nIn (the process of) development-progression, constitutional-completeness itself is development, while (in the process of) awakening-progression, awakening in deluded human-beings itself is functional-completeness and conduct-completeness. The Awakened human-being nourishes purposefulness and right-use by way of behavior and occupation with less-developed nature. Human-being has the responsibility for behavior with other humans, glory with those more awakened, and practices, studies and contemplates for higher awakening.\n\nOnly a human-being in delusion is free at the time of performing actions but subservient at the time of receiving the results.\n\nHuman-beings on this Earth are in awakening-progression. The opportunity, expectation, and possibility for becoming awakened is available to them. The primary trait of an awakened human-being is his being helpful for less-evolved ones.\n\nRespirating-order (pranic-order) is more evolved than material-order, animal-order is more evolved than respirating-order (pranic) and servile-human (pashu-manav) of knowledge-order in illusion is more evolved than animal-order. Beastial-human (rakshas-manav) of knowledge-order in illusion is more evolved than the servile-human in illusion, Human with discernment (bhrant-abhrant) is more evolved than the beastial-human, and godly-human (dev-manav) in non-illusion is more evolved than the human with discernment. Divine Human (Divya-manav) with complete-awakening is more evolved than godly-human with non-illusion.\n\nUnits of knowledge-order are endowed with the capacity for realistic-view (darshan). Realistic-view (darshan) is in the sense of physiochemical and conscious nature situated in all-pervasive entity or Omnipresence.\n\nIt is only in the non-delusion state that realization-knowledge and realistic-view (darshan) get completed. Which is why –\n\nNon-delusion itself is awakening; awakening itself is holistic-intelligence; holistic-intelligence itself is holistic-authority; holistic-authority alone is universal-sovereignty; universal-sovereignty alone is undivided-society and universal-orderliness\n\n“Humankind alone is primarily responsible for the rise and fall of Humankind”\n\n– A Nagraj, 1977\n\n(* Translator note: ‘madhyasth’ = ‘Mediating’ = Restraining of positive and negative (properties). Unaffected by positive and negative (properties). The grandeur of normalizing of all excited-states and remaining unaffected by excited-states. The word ‘Mediating’ has been used hereon and should be understood with its definition. Omnipotence = space = energy in equilibrium)"

    "content": "Home\nPhilosophy\nExplore Concepts\nProposal For Universal Justice\nPhilosophy\nIn Brief\nOrigins\nKey Discoveries\nLiterature\nExplore Concepts\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nProposal for Universal Justice\nAn ‘Alternative’ Proposal for ‘Justice’ and ‘Universal Human Constitution’\n\n– on the basis of Madhyasth Darshan (Coexistentialism)\n\n“Every human child expects justice since birth, desires for right behavior and work and speaks the truth” (A. Nagraj, proponent: Madhyasth Darshan). ‘Realistic-view of Mediation’ or ‘Coexistentialism’.\n\nThe child does not know the above realities (Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth). He depends on human tradition in order to understand these. Beliefs by name of Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth are commonly accepted by various communities. Accepting such beliefs, or the combination thereof, we grow up to be adult citizens, continuing to expect fulfillment of Justice in human relationships.\n\nWhat then really is Justice?\n\nIs there a form of Justice, a definition of Justice that is Universal? If there is, it will satisfy the following criteria:\n\nRecognize each human as a unit of an Undivided Human Society (irrespective of Color, Creed, Caste, Geography, Language, etc).\nRecognize the nature of Human Relationships and their purpose.\nHave the ability to live with human values such as Trust, Respect, Affection, Love, etc., and be mutually satisfied in human relationships.\nEnsure the nourishment, protection and enrichment of Human-ness (Humanity).\n\nThis is Justice. To understand and ensure the above, it becomes essential to understand the:\n\nvery nature of the Human Being,\nthe basis of Human Relationship, including its underlying existential reality, and\nthe nature of Existence itself (“Existence – all that exists”).\n\nIt is only on having universally verifiable answers to the above can a Universal, satisfying notion of Justice even be possible. While we have been able to arrive at a common understanding of stones, plants and animals, a universal, common understanding of the human is still awaited.\n\nThis has now become possible via Madhyasth Darshan (existence-based human focused contemplation), or ‘Coexistentialism’; a new development in human understanding by A. Nagraj of Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. It is not based on past ideologies or beliefs. He had realization of entire existence and found answers to questions related to the Human Being and Existence.\n\nSome fundamental tenets:\nExistence itself is coexistence, as units saturated in all-pervasive Space; orderliness and Harmony is innate to Existence.\nExistence is Stable – Awakening and Progress are Definite.\nNature is manifested as the four “natural-orders”: material, plants, animals & humans – that are self-organized and participate in larger orderliness.\nThe Human alone creates problems due to his ignorance and delusion, as a result of living in an undeveloped state of consciousness called ‘animal consciousness’.\nThe Human too wants to be in this Orderliness and can do so by having ‘Knowledge’ and living in ‘developed Human-consciousness’.\nThe Material Order inherits behavior from atoms, Plant from seeds, Animal from race; Human from values or mentality (either beliefs or knowledge).\nFor example: An underlying assumption/view that ‘Existence/Nature is in struggle or chaos’ will only yield living which is conflict-centric. It is not possible to have Justice (mutual fulfillment in human relationship) as long as such a view prevails. On the other hand, if this view/mentality are aligned to Existential Truths – of there being inherent Harmony/Coexistence and Universal Orderliness, he will bring this to living form.\nBased on the above facts, the following convictions can be realized:\nEarth is One (Undivided Nation) – Nation States are man-made\nHuman Race is One – based on the formation of the Body – Human actions are many\nHuman Society is One – Communities are Many\nHuman Aim/Purpose is One (every human desires to be happy, and live in Orderliness) – the ways to fulfill this are many\nHuman Capabilities are the same – their manifestations are many\nUniversal Justice is One – Beliefs about the same are many\n\n* Justice – the recognition of Human Relationships, fulfillment of values (Trust, Respect, Affection…), Evaluation and Mutual Satisfaction of both Individuals\n\nHuman Constitution is One\nAphorisms and Explanation of Ordinances in expectation of Completeness of (Human) tradition\n\nThis proposal (Madhyasth Darshan or Coexistentialism) dispels all mysteriousness by providing answers to human questions regarding the nature of Reality & Existence, the nature of the Human-being & Existential purpose of the Human being. It identifies and defines:\n\nUniversal Humane Conduct\nUniversal Human Values\nUniversal Human Religion\n\nIt proposes:\n\nUniversal Knowledge, Wisdom & Science\nUniversal Education, Universal Human-conduct, Universal Human Constitution & Systems\nHuman Culture, Civility & Norms of living\n\nThis leads to an Undivided Human Society and Universal Orderliness, wherein humankind can live in balance with the rest of nature. These answers are not imaginative and idealistic, but an outcome of direct-realization & understanding of Reality, as-it-Is.\n\nThe method for transmission of such understanding or knowledge from one human to the other has been obtained, tested and proven. A number of initiatives are currently underway in various State Education Departments and Universities in India to bring this understanding into living.\n\nThis entire understanding has been written in 12 books in three sets, as:\n\nDarśana or 'realistic-view': Existential postulations from realization\nVaada or 'ism': Expansion at the level of thought\nShastra or code of conduct/discipline in living\nSamvidhaan or Universal Humane Constitution – from essence to detail: in the form of human code of ethics\n\nThis 'Alternative Proposal' has manifested itself in front of humankind via an individual in an existentially natural way. Until individualistic and communal-mentality prevail, excess-consumption, conflict and wars will remain, and global peace is not possible. If man desires to continue living on this planet, it is imperative to become free of criminal-mentality and delusion, so that the earth may regain its lost balance. The desirable outcomes of our progress to date have been in the areas of food-shelter-decoration, & radio television and transport. We are yet to have “justice” in human-relationships, “orderliness/resolution” as human religion & know the ‘truth’. Adopting this ‘Alternative’ seems to be the only way out."

    "content": "Home\nPhilosophy\nExplore Concepts\nSociety\nPhilosophy\nIn Brief\nOrigins\nKey Discoveries\nLiterature\nExplore Concepts\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nHuman Society\nHuman Race\n\nIs one, based on the similar construction of the Body. All of us have bones, blood, a heart, kidneys, lungs, etc. The Constitution of the Human body is the same.\n\nWe wrongly assume today that we belong to different Races. There are, however no ‘sub-species’ in Humans as in plants and animals. The apparent difference is due to variations in climatic conditions, which causes us to have different colors, shapes, sizes and features. Hence, even though we differentiate and discriminate based on these superficial differences, this is not acceptable to any human, which is the reason for the all the struggles we see around us today.\n\nHuman Religion\n\nIs happiness. No human can be separated from the need to be happy, even for a moment. Such separation itself will be with the aim to be happy. Human Religion or dharma* is: Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction & Bliss. This is possible only via having knowledge or understanding, which leads to resolution. Hence, Human Religion = Resolution. *Dharma = Religion = innateness. That which cannot be separated from an entity is its dharm or religion. Religion: from the Latin Religare: to be Bound. As humans, we are bound by the need to be happy, satisfied. We are bound by the need for Knowledge, bound to Understand.\n\nWhat we call as Religion today, can be changed from time to time. It is a set of assumptions that is followed by the family in which we are born. Hence, this varies from place to place. Hence, we have ‘religions’ being born, and religions ceasing to exist. Whereas, anything that exists in Reality, always continues to do so. The struggles, conflict & discrimination we see on the name of Religion today are due to wrong assumptions, illusion.\n\nJustice\n\nJustice is the point of balance in human behaviour. When two awakened humans are able to recognize the relationship with each other, express values in that relationship like Trust, Affection, etc, evaluate their interaction or behaviour and are mutually satisfied, it is called Justice. Thus, Justice means something positive. Just like there is a definite way in which other entities in nature interact, so also there is in humans. This itself is Justice. Justice means protection of humanness.\n\nUniversal Justice, Religion (dharm*) and Truth (न्याय-धर्म-सत्य) are both fundamental tenets to be understood for the transition from animal consciousness to human consciousness, as well as realities to be lived with and expressed in daily life.\n\nWhat we call as Justice is actually passing judgements. Punishment & retribution are part and parcel of todays Justice. As a result, neither of the two parties are satisfied. When two people, or sets of people have a problem, they hire a third person, called a Lawyer, and a fourth person, called a Judge, passes the judgement.\n\nHuman Culture\n\nBased on the common understanding of Reality, of ourselves, human purpose and human living, we can understand Human Culture. This is defined as the expressions of human living in the form of Festivals. Festivals are those that are in line with Human Purpose, the Human Goal, which is Resolution or Happiness in every Individual, Prosperity or Peace in every Family, Trust or Satisfaction in Society and Coexistence or Bliss with Nature. Such Festivals are around Birth, Education, Marriage, Harvests, etc. These are causes for Celebration and are common across all Humanity.\n\nToday, while we celebrate festivals, many of them are based on belief, which could be from some religious following or otherwise, which itself can cause differences between peoples.\n\nHuman Civility\n\nNo human lives alone. No Human Family lives by itself. They way in which we live together, itself is Civility. Civility means everything: from how we treat each others wealth or property, our mutual behaviours to the way our houses are laid out, common areas of living, etc.\n\nBecause we do not have a common vision, common understanding of our purpose of living, which may even vary within members of a single family, we do not have any common shared notion of Civility. As a consequence, this varies from place to place. Whereas, Human Civility, should arise out an understanding what it is to be Civil, and living with civility then leads to Human Civilization.\n\nHuman Education\n\nThe purpose of Human Education is to fulfil human needs and purpose. This is knowledge, and living with happiness. Knowledge means having the right impressions, values, or sanskar. The process of transfer of such impressions or sanskar from one that has understood (the teacher) to the student, itself is Education. Humane Education yields the following:\n\nAssurance in the Self,\nRespect for Excellence,\nBalance in talent & personality,\nSociable in behaviour &\nSelf Sufficient in Occupation.\n\nOur Education today, has been reduced to getting information and acquiring a few skills with the sole purpose of getting a job, or business, with the ultimate aim of making money & getting recognition. This is based on competition, fear and enticement, which only lead to internal and external conflict. The broader aspects of living – in relationships with human behaviour, society, with nature, in knowing oneself, and the Reality we are a part of are ignored. This gives rise to the Mania for Profit, Mania for Consumption & Mania for Sex.\n\nHuman Civilization\n\nCivilization is needed to ensure the continuity of humane tradition. Human beings need awakening. Humans living in awakened tradition are able to fulfill their individual, familial & societal goals and live in harmony with Nature. Humane Civilization consists of the following four aspects:\n\nHumane Education& Culture\nHumane Conduct & Civility\nHumane World Constitution\nHumane Organization\n\nToday, while we use these terms, they vary from place to place, from time to time, from country to country. Whereas, on understanding Reality and human purpose in it, these can be understood and defined in a Universal Manner – that does not change with time, place or person.\n\n– shriram n | student | jan 2015"

The family itself is a complete humane organization. Swarajya or self-rule means having the ease of access to Justice, Production & Exchange. The meaning of freedom or swatantrata is every human being self-organized and expressing, conveying and propagating the same. This takes place by knowing and assuming the Truth in the form of Existence, i.e. recognizing & fulfilling the mutually occurring relationships & values in Existence.\n\n“Every Human in Existence” is in organization with humanness and participates in the social organization. The obvious form of this is freedom in the form of self-organization and swarajaya or self-rule in the form of participation in the entire (larger) order. The participation of organization with the entirety is only possible with more than one person. Which is why the combined form of more than one person itself is nothing but family. It is only with perfect human conduct & behavior along with the availability of intellectual resolution and material prosperity in such a family that village self-rule or organization itself becomes easily possible which becomes the basis for an undivided society.\n\nAvailability of justice-security in the family and in humanity means the recognition of human and ecological relationships and the fulfillment of values intrinsic in them. The form of self-sufficiency in human tradition is freedom (self-organization) in state and self-rule or organization in expression.\n\nEase of access to means of production-work means making every member of the family independent in occupation by the time they become an adult, so that every adult in the family can get together and produce more than the material needs of the family. Production within the means of humanness means the production of ordinary expectations (food, clothing, shelter) and extraordinary expectations (radio, transport & television) by putting in physical efforts on the natural grandeur without causing it any harm – in a complementary manner. Material prosperity in the family does need more than this, nor is material prosperity possible in less than this.\n\nEase of access to cooperative exchange-storage systems means the exchange of goods produced by the family with other families, on the basis of effort-value in a manner free of profit & loss (profit is defined as taking more and giving less in return), so every family can experience material prosperity. Profit centric business setups do not have any room in this system. Complete exchange systems means the exchange of investments of efforts of one family with other families on the basis of the effort-values (of the goods). The village shall have a storage facility, by means of which the excess production in every family shall be exchanged in external markets and the required goods from such external markets or villages shall be made available to the village inhabitants. This system shall be connected to the county, block, district, state and entire nation in a staged manner.\n\nIt is only after village self-rule or organization is established and easily available, that it becomes possible for every human to participate in the entire existential organization and himself be occupied with humane organization. This itself is the witness of jeevans awakening for which human tradition has been desiring & waiting since time immemorial. Jeevans awakening itself propounds the meaning and usefulness of universal order in humans because evidence and resolution itself are expressions of universality in human tradition.\n\nBecoming proficient in universal sociability is wisdom, its conduct is authority and its protection and enrichment in continuity is sovereignty.\n\nThis itself is the aphorism or sutra for humane constitution. The final aim of village organization is the establishment of undivided sociability by which every human in society shall have access to intellectual resolution, material prosperity and ‘coexistence’ in a universal manner.\n\nThus, the primary aim of this program is to realize and make others realize, the family centric village organization. Every member of every family in the village shall live with perfect humane conduct. Every human shall recognize and fulfill human & ecological relationships and their intrinsic values. They will obtain material prosperity – in others words, greater production than that is required. They shall express, convey & propagate intellectual resolution. To enable such capabilities itself is Village Organization.\n\nThe basis of the ‘Village Organization Plan’ is the development of a production based utility-based perspective in the place of a job & business oriented mentality. This is our conception and commitment.\n\n10-Staged Family-Based World Organization\nPlan for Organization Councils\n1st Level: The Family Council\n\nEvery family in the village shall be in the form of ten (10) members. Should there be less than 10 members in a family, they shall join together with neighbouring families to form a family council. Every member — be it children or old people — shall be members in the council. The members shall elect one head to represent them in the neighbourhood council, someone well-versed with self-understanding (jeevan vidya) and material understanding.\n\n2nd Level: Neighbourhood Council\n\nHeads of 10 families form a neighbourhood or family-group council. One member from 10 such councils shall be elected to the village council.\n\n3rd Level: Village Council\n\n10 elected members from 10 neighbourhood councils (100 families) form the village council. One member becomes the chief.

It is the very basis of existential reality. It is the highest principle encompassing each and every element; we can say it’s the essence of the universe.\n\n‘Nothing’ is alone, or ever will be. Indeed, Existence needs a ‘seer’ and the ‘seen’. So there is at least this coexistence. 2 or more particles come together and form an atom. An atom is in intrinsic order. It is a coexistence of sub-atomic particles. Indeed, were these particles not to come ‘together’, no recognizable matter would exist, since nothing perceptible would form! I.e., we would have been in a vast emptiness with no planets at all!\n\nOn this planet, we see that every state is an expression of harmonious Coexistence. Nature, with its deep inter-linkages and its astounding order, the incredible symmetry in a snowflake for instance, the spellbinding complexity and spontaneous order in the human body for example, are all live examples of coexistence.\n\nWe humans want to be in coexistence. Indeed, our bodies themselves are a coexistence of many individual organs that all function together in a beautiful symphony.\n\nHave we humans created any of this?\n\nNo.\n\nAll this is occurring spontaneously, in coexistence.\n\nAs humans, we seek each other's company. We seek each other’s comfort. We seek refuge in one another.\n\nBe it as families or as communities we feel comfortable in each other’s company. Indeed, we humans need another even to argue. For, if there was not more than one of us, who would we live with? Who would we be bothered about?\n\nThis means we are linked. Inextricably.\n\nWe would like harmony in such human relationships. Not having harmony, or having conflict bothers us.\n\nWe want these relationships within the Family. We want these harmonious relationships between families. Indeed, we would like to have harmonious coexistence between every human family. Such families put together themselves form a harmonious society.\n\nHowever, even though we humans deeply desire such Coexistence, we are not able to see or appreciate this in daily life. We end up fighting within the family, amongst families, between communities, and across nation-states.\n\nVerily, we are somehow unable to translate our very innate intent for Coexistence into living.\n\nThis is because as humans we live in underdeveloped consciousness.\n\nCoexistential Philosophy\n\nThe Philosophy of Coexistence is a paradigm-breaking discovery by Shri A.Nagraj of India. It posits that Coexistence is the innate nature of Existence, or Reality.\n\nOrder and Organization are intrinsic to nature. Indeed, as humans we are only able to study and comprehend orderly states. When we have a state of order within, we experience states such as happiness, peace, contentment and bliss.\nThe universe is the coexistence of all-pervasive energy and matter and this coexistence is inseparable, indestructible, and imperishable.\nHuman Life is also the coexistence of the sentient, incorporeal & imperishable jeevan-atom and the material, insentient body.\nHuman beings have the most advanced physical body with a fully evolved cortex and faculty of imagination which is absent in other creatures.\nInherently the human race is one, the problem among human beings is their imagination, add to it the incorrect education and knowledge handed down by culture and society.\nHuman beings innately desire love and affection with other human beings and to lead a life without conflict or that creates pain or suffering for other human beings.\nSocial norms and culture to date have not been able to create a social structure or establishment which is conducive to practising this humane way of life.\nMan believes in Perceived reality over actual reality due to the incorrect education and knowledge handed down by culture and society.\nThe world can be aligned to the actual reality of inherent harmony & Coexistence via a systematic change in education and societal practices."

    "content": "Home\nPhilosophy\nExplore Concepts\nThis Darshan Background Findings\nPhilosophy\nIn Brief\nOrigins\nKey Discoveries\nLiterature\nExplore Concepts\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nBackground\n\nDriven by an intense enquiry to know the nature of existence and human purpose in it, A.Nagraj spent 20 years performing meditative ‘sadhana’* (mental discipline) . He did not find answers to his enquiry even in the ultimate state of awareness of samadhi*. He then further improvised his approach. As a result, he had ‘realization’ of entire existence (all that exists). He understood the fundamental nature of material, conscious & spatial realities and their inter-relationships.\n\nThis entire period was from 1950 to 1975 & performed in the then dense forests of Amarkantak. He has presented this understanding in the Hindi Language in the form of a new ‘Darsana’ (philosophy or body of knowledge) called Madhyasth Darshan – Sah-Astitva-vad (Realistic-view of Mediation ; Coexistentialism) in the Hindi Language published as a core-set of 12 books. This is to inform you that:\n\n~\n\n“Co-existence” (reality) has now become study-able.\nThe human-being has been understood\n\nas being the combined form of a conscious unit and a physiochemical body.\n\nThe ‘Human purpose’ in existence has been understood\n\nand man’s ‘being’ and ‘living’ has become clear.\n\n~\n\nFinding\n\nHis ‘findings’ are summarised as follows:\n\nThe Nature of Existence, the Universe\n\nNagraj realized, experienced that Existence is Coexistence, stability and harmony is innate to Existence. Every unit or ‘thing’ in Existence is in self-organization & participates in the whole organization. There is a definite, natural direction and purpose in evolution – and this is manifested as the intricate & astonishing web of Matter, Plants, Animals and Humans on this planet. The Human being alone creates problems due to his ignorance and delusion. This is communicated via the following 5 aphorisms or truth-statements:\n\nExistence is Coexistence\n\nExistence is as material and conscious activities present in Space. This is Coexistence.There is no ‘chaos’ in Existence. Existence is stable. Progress and awakening in Existence are definite.This completely changes the way in which we think of ourselves and the Universe.\n\nThere is ‘evolution’ (development progression) in Existence\n\nThis fundamental development takes place in the atom. Atoms evolve to form planets via molecular association,then form plants, and the animal and human bodies. There is a continuous formation and break-down of physical-chemical structures.\n\nThere is ‘development’ in Existence\n\nEvolution in the atom results in a ‘constitutionally complete’ atom that becomes conscious in nature and exhibits the ‘will to live’. This is the conscious-Self, given the name ‘jeevan’.It has the abilities of thinking, imagining, knowing, etc.\n\nThere is ‘awakening progression’ in Existence\n\nThe conscious self or jeevan exists in various animals coexisting with their bodies.In humans, this is expressed as ‘awakening progression’ where we have partial awareness & understanding.\n\nThere is ‘awakening’ in Existence\n\nOn having knowledge of the entire reality of Coexistence, humans become awakened to a state of ‘developed consciousness’,or ‘human consciousness’ and live with it. This itself is happiness, peace, satisfaction & bliss. (sukh, shanti, santosh, anand)\n\nThe Nature of the Human\n\nHe realized that the human-being is the combined form of a conscious unit and a physio-chemical body. The conscious unit, given the name ‘jeevan’ consists of 10 activities (5 ‘potentials’ and 5 ‘forces’). Humans exhibit the ability for ‘freedom of imagination’ (kalpana-sheelta) and ‘freedom of action’ (karma-svatantrata).\n\nHe ‘saw’ that Humans on this planet have so far lived in an undeveloped state of consciousness called ‘animal-consciousness’, due to which their cognition/understanding of themselves, of reality/existence and human purpose is incomplete and delusionary. We currently only use partial (4.5 of 10) faculties in the conscious Self. This un-awakened state of living, or ‘animal consciousness’ is the root cause for all our problems. Based on our ‘awakening’ various humans can be seen to be assuming/ understanding the same reality differently, and behaving in contrasting different manners – which has resulted in our state of chaos.\n\nThe fundamental need of the human being is knowledge, as a result of which the human is ‘awakened’ and lives in ‘developed-consciousness’ as human-consciousness. This happens when we use all 10 faculties in the conscious Self.\n\nThe irreversible transformation from animal to human consciousness requires the following knowledge:\nKnowledge of Existence (reality) as Coexistence\nKnowledge of Conscious Self (jeevan) & all its 10 activities\nKnowledge of perfect Humane conduct/living\nThe Nature of Human Living\n\nHe ‘saw’ that the environmental problem, the problem of economics, social conflict, in relationships, and in the Self, together called ‘unhappiness’ are due to a lack of understanding in man himself. This philosophy proposes definite humane conduct and universal laws and model of living in family, society and with nature that lead to harmony.\n\nBased on this, laws of living such as: intellectual law, social law and natural law can all be understood in a universal manner leading to:\n\nIntellectual resolution in Individual = Happiness\nProsperity in Family = Peace\nTrust in Society = Satisfaction\nCoexistence with Nature = Bliss\n\nThis proposal provides a new ‘alternative’ in the fields of Education, Health, Socio-political structure, Judicial systems, Production & Economic models. It proposes Universal human education, values, religion, world constitution and organization.\n\nSummary\nMadhyasth Darshan accepts the existence of matter: of atoms as the fundamental unit of order and ‘evolution’ as the formation of complex molecules, plant and animal life. This ‘Nature’ comprising of material, plants and animals is in intrinsic order. There is no ‘external cause, creator or regulator’.\nIt postulates the ‘Conscious entity’ as an activity, a part of nature, an immortal, indestructible atom.\nIt accepts the existence of an expansive, pervasive entity that is not activity itself, but the fundamental source of every material and conscious activity. This entity is energy in equilibrium (in matter) and as consciousness (in conscious Jeevan). This entity can also be called shunya, brahman.\nThe progressive awakening in the various orbits in every individual jeevan-atom itself is mankind’s journey towards reality/truth and humanness over the ages.\nIdentifies 3 distinct grades of consciousness: (a) inhumane / animal consciousness, (b) human consciousness, and (c) super-human consciousness — based on the degree of ‘awakening to reality’ and fineness in behaviour/conduct in every individual conscious-atom (jeevan).\nAll human problems are due to living in under-developed consciousness or animal consciousness.\n‘Awakened Humankinds’ living mimics the inherent coexistence & harmony found in nature.\nThe purpose of education is to enable such awakening, humanness & order.\nThis leads to happiness, peace, contentment & bliss. This also results in freedom from suffering, bondage, mukti & moksha.\nThe existence and journey of ‘consciousness’ is thus not an antithesis to human life and experienced material reality in the here and now, on this planet.\nMadhyasth Darshan has answers for, resolves the following ‘dimensions’ in every individual:\nExperience (अनुभव)\nThought / Intellect (विचार)\nBehavior (व्यवहार)\nOccupation / Material (व्यवसाय)\nAcross the 4 ‘levels of living’:\nas Individuals [व्यक्ति]\nin Family [परिवार]\nin Society, Nation, Inter-nation [समाज]\nin Nature [प्रकृति]\nThis Darshan...\nWhat is this Darshan?\n\nClarification of Existence, Qualitative Evolution, Development & Consciousness.\n\nScope of the Darshan:\n\nInvestigation of Knowledge, Elemental, Actionable & Behavioural aspects.\n\nNeed for the Darshan:\n\nTo know the Self and the Totality.\n\nThe main objective of the Darshan:\n\nRealisation in Existence.\n\nPurpose of the Darshan:\n\nContinuity of the Supreme Good, Supreme Effort & Consciousness, balance in Intellectual Ability & Personality, Sociability in Behaviour, Self Sufficiency in Occupation.\n\nUtility of the Darshan:\n\nSynchronicity in the domains of occupation, behaviour, thought and realisation in the Individual; Synchronicity in the Individual, Family, Society, Nation-State and Internation.\n\nEffect of the Darshan:\n\nThe method to understand every subject, state, action & purpose.\n\nReality according to the Darshan:\n\nThe inseparable Coexistence of spatial, material & conscious reality. This itself is Coexistence.\n\nHuman Being in the Darshan:\n\nThe combined form of a Conscious Self (jeevan) & Material Body.\n\nHuman Living in the Darshan:\n\nQualitative Development in Intellectual & Spiritual domains itself is Human Purpose, Humane Behaviour itself is Human Utility & Material Production itself is Human Nescessity.\n\nThis proposal is not tied to any existing or past belief or tradition. It is based on a direct cognition of Reality. The entire work has been written ‘ground-up’ with a new set of definitions for the words used – it does not refer to any other texts.\nThe aims, content, process and outcomes (lifestyle) proposed by Madhyasth Darshan are different from that in Materialism (Science) & Spiritualism/Theism – it is hence presented as an Alternative. (भौतिकवाद और आध्यात्मवाद का विकल्प)\nThe activities in the conscious self, jeevan have been described in a great degree of detail. The difference between the apparent ’cause & effect’ world we can see, perceive & experiment with in physical science, and the form-less dimensions of reality that explain ‘ultimate-cause’ have also been clearly explained. This proposes ‘alternative’ thesis for Sociology, Economics, Psychology, Materialism, Spiritualism and knowledge systems (darsana).\nThis philosophy is logically consistent and enables us to deal practically with the phenomena in nature, and verify it via direct experience and as proof in living – it is thus free of mysticism. This understanding & model of living is now available for study & practice. A diverse set of people are now seriously evaluating this proposal. Efforts to bring this into education are underway in India. You will find details on this website.\nThis is a call to the peoples & Universities on this planet to consider this proposal with their own good reason. This proposal is in the capacity of a human: from one human to the other.\nThis is a proposal for Universal Good.\n* sadhana-samadhi-sanyam:\n‘sadhana’ – taming the mind, intense mental practice.\n‘samadhi’ – penultimate state of meditation according to Indian thought in which the ‘unknown’ is said to become ‘known’.\n‘sanyam’ – a state of knowing beyond samadhi.

    "content": "Home\nPhilosophy\nExplore Concepts\nUnveiling The Mystery Of Conscious Nature\nPhilosophy\nIn Brief\nOrigins\nKey Discoveries\nLiterature\nExplore Concepts\n← Back to Concepts Articles\nUnveiling the Mystery of Conscious Nature\n\n- A. Nagraj\n\nNumerous speculations have been offered regarding consciousness. For instance, materialists have tried to explain the aspect of consciousness within the limits of chemical processes. According to them, all functions are performed by the brain (Medhas), or the brain carries out conscious activities, or the brain itself is consciousness. In this context, Madhyasth Darshan presents an unprecedented proposition that is universally inspiring. Madhyasth Darshan has described consciousness as an action (kriya). This is also the intention of the materialists. However, Madhyasth Darshan describes this action as an atom that has achieved completion of formation (gathan purnata). This philosophy posits that every atom is an atom by virtue of its formation. It is necessary for every formation to have more than one constituent part (ansh). Explaining the meaning of constituent and formation, it is said that it is that which manifests shape, volume, and density. In the context of action, it is clarified that that which has sensation and motion is action. This infinite group of actions is Nature (Prakriti). The entire Nature is submerged in Existence (Satta); consequently, it is saturated in Existence. Explaining the root cause of this entire creation, the co-existence of Nature and Existence has also been stated. Madhyasth Darshan claims that Nature and Existence cannot be separated because there is no place devoid of Existence. Consequently, the ceaseless activity of Nature is explained.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan states that the constituent parts found in atoms do not have independent motion. As evidence for this, it is said that a constituent part within any formation cannot separate from the boundary of that formation until it is disturbed by something else. After being disturbed, whether it is an atom or a constituent part, it attains an unnatural motion. This unnatural motion has been calculated by the name of power (shakti). These are the relative powers. Continuing in this sequence, it is clarified that when an atom accommodates all the constituent parts that it possibly can, that atom becomes free from chemical reactions or the sequence of displacement-replacement events. For this reason, its vibrational motion becomes greater than its circular motion, and at that very moment, the manifestation of hope/expectation (asha) begins. This conscious atom operates in a restrained manner in a space larger than its length, width, and height, thus existing in a cluster form. Each cluster is the form of some living being. That conscious atom, existing in a cluster form, operates the physical body (jad sharir) according to its hope/expectation. It operates the physical body as long as it remains a capable instrument, after which it separates from it. In this way, the body, found within the limits of chemical processes, is obtained as an instrument for the conscious unit and then dissolves. This is the process of birth and death. The realm of chemical and physical results has been addressed as material nature (jad prakriti). A clear process has been propounded for material nature to evolve and attain the state of consciousness through the completion of formation. Such conscious action, through change and refinement, manifests its hope, thought, desire, and resolve through numerous living bodies and, ancillary to that, through the human body, which is an objective truth. Clarifying this objective truth, it has been stated that the fundamental tangible form of a human being is hope, thought, desire, resolve, and realization, which every human being sees within themselves. Madhyasth Darshan clarifies the solid proof of conscious action being the operator of the physical body: whatever the physical body takes in as food, drink, and air, the body assimilates what is necessary and expels what is unnecessary, which is directly observable. What is thus taken in is, in some quantity, power. In a ratio far exceeding that power, powers are expelled. The greater amount that is expelled is entirely the power of the conscious activity, which is hope, thought, desire, and resolve. As evidence of this, it is seen that one generation provides various kinds of resources to the next generation.\n\nEvery human being sees in their life that in all the chemical substances, physical structure, and mechanical capacity of the body, there is not a single hope, thought, desire, or resolve. At the same time, it is also seen that it is through such a body that hope, etc., are manifested. Rational human beings do not have the capacity to deny this objective truth. In this regard, Madhyasth Darshan clarifies that the relationship between the medium and the effect becomes clear, like that of electricity and machines. Without machines, it has not been possible to get an introduction to relative powers. Continuing in this sequence, it is further clarified that the physical body is the medium for conscious action. The manifestation in any medium that is greater than its natural power will be of a different power. Since the natural powers in the body are limited to the chemical and physical realms, there is no possibility of hope, etc., manifesting in them.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan has clarified that hope, thought, desire, resolve, and realization are the property of conscious action. When the material becomes conscious, two fundamental achievements have been stated: (i) the completion of formation, and (ii) the vibrational motion becoming greater than the circular motion. The simultaneous occurrence of these two is the event of becoming conscious. Both the conscious and the material have been described as action. Madhyasth Darshan has claimed that decline (hraas) and development (vikas) are found only within the limits of the atom, not in molecules or structures. The revelation of this fact provides an angle for the thinking of humankind. This clarifies the definite line between the material and the conscious. The atom has been described as an atom by virtue of its formation. There is no action without formation. Defining action, the combined state of sensation and motion has been termed action. The possibility of the motion of constituent parts has been stated, which are relative powers. Such motion has not been described as its natural motion but as an agitated state/charge (aavesh). For this agitated state, the attack and permeation of external forces are necessary. Madhyasth Darshan has clarified the subtle knowledge concerning the atom and its constituent parts. However, we see in every life that no agitated state is found in anything without an external force. For example, until a stone is thrown, the charge of acceleration is not found in it. In living beings, an agitated state is not found without sensory influence. In the human body, an agitated state is not found without thought.\n\nFrom a single atom to the largest unit, it becomes clear that for a motion greater than its natural motion, the imposition of external forces is necessary. However, in the context of development, Madhyasth Darshan has propounded the fundamental principle that the manifestation of power is a result of the unit's motion. \"Internal employment of such power = Development; external discharge = Decline.\" How much this reflects an objective truth is seen in the fact that the more we are engaged in external, dualistic processes like depending on others, being a support for others, expectations, neglect, etc., the more tired we become. In contrast, we see that we never get tired even when practicing living in and for the self. The meaning of internal employment is to inspect oneself by oneself and to follow oneself; this is alertness. In this context, Madhyasth Darshan has clarified that the five activities found in conscious action are hope, thought, desire, resolve, and realization. These five actions manifest respectively inthe Mind (Man), Disposition (Vritti), Psyche (Chitt), Intellect (Buddhi), and Soul (Atma). A conscious atom is described as the combination of these five activities. In the context of self-inspection in a conscious atom, it is said that the Disposition (Vritti) inspects the Mind (Man), and the Mind is dedicated to the Disposition, meaning it is ready to receive its signals. Similarly, the Psyche (Chitt) inspects the Disposition, and the Disposition is dedicated to the Psyche; the Intellect (Buddhi) inspects the Psyche, and the Psyche is dedicated to the Intellect; the Soul (Atma) is the seer of the Intellect, and the Intellect is dedicated to the Atma. This is complete development; as a result, a human being becomes endowed with a mediated life. Explaining its necessity and utility, it is said that such a human being is capable of manifesting and experiencing rules in profession, justice in behavior, dharma in thought, and truth in experience. With the revelation of this fact, the meaning of the internal employment of power in human life becomes universally known and clear. This is the very conduct that humanity has been deprived of for a long time. It is in the context of making this universally accessible that the completion of formation, completion of action, and completion of conduct have been clarified. The employment obtained through the process of internal inspection has been described as the completion of conduct. The completion of action has been described in a life of humanity. Madhyasth Darshan has explained humanity in a comparative manner, or rather, the whole in a comparative manner.\n\nMadhyasth Darshan has clarified the distinct study of 122 conducts manifesting in a conscious unit replete with conduct, i.e., in a single conscious atom. This is an unprecedented achievement for the world of thought. It paves a clear and accessible path for every human being to attain the states of a humane-human, a deity-human, and a divine-human.\n\nOut of the 122 conducts, 2 of the Atma, 4 of the Intellect, 16 of the Psyche, 36 of the Disposition, and 64 of the Mind have been clarified. This amazing revelation is directly before all of humanity, that even physicists, through their research on the atom and its parts, have accepted the possibility of 122 parts being accommodated. From this, we get the clear knowledge that a formation-complete atom contains 122 parts. Such an atom is free from chemical duality; this is the proposition of Madhyasth Darshan. According to physicists, that atom is neutral and inert. Madhyasth Darshan has clarified the completion of action for this atom within the limits of humanity, and the completion of conduct within the limits of divine humanity.\n\nIn the context of the formation of the atom, Madhyasth Darshan has stated that every formation will have a central part; the constituent part located in that central part has been indicated by the name Madhyansh (central constituent). This is proven meaningful only when one or more parts in one or more orbits around the Madhyansh remain active in a circular path. It is a proposition of Madhyasth Darshan that in a formation-complete atom, there will be four orbits dependent on the Madhyansh; the conduct of the parts situated in these four orbits is what manifests. Based on this, the 122 conducts of the parts contained in the formation of atoms have been clarified. Madhyasth Darshan has indicated the part located in the center of the atom by the name Soul (Atma) and has described its action as mediated action (madhyasth kriya). As evidence, it is said that it is not affected by balanced-unbalanced influences. From this clear resolution, we understand that the Atma remains unaffected by or detached from balancedunbalanced dualities. Further in Madhyasth Darshan, explaining the dignity of mediated action, it is clarified that all dependent parts are compelled to develop until they build the capacity, capability, and eligibility to receive the signals of the Atma.\n\nClarifying the relationship and position of the dependent parts, the parts found in the first orbit of the Madhyansh are given the designation of Intellect (Buddhi), the parts found in the second orbit are called Psyche (Chitt), the parts found in the third orbit are called Disposition (Vritti), and the parts found in the fourth orbit are called Mind (Man). This is a gift to the human race that clarifies the ambiguous gap regarding the \"self\" (swa) and resolves the long-standing debates and many doubts, which has been the eternal desire of humanity."

It is not based on past or existing human theories.\n•\nIt clarifies the origins, existence and precise relationship between the conscious (spirit & mind) and matter, with profound implications for us humans.\n•\nIt is practical & teachable resulting in individual happiness, peace etc & humane virtues such as kindness.\n•\nIt provides all-round resolution to our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems, allowing us to make sense of living. It enables us to have comprehension of every aspect of existence (reality) & human life\nBackground\n\nMadhyasth Darshan (Jeevan Vidya) or 'Coexistential Philosophy' has come about via original existential exploratory-research by (late) Shri A Nagraj of Amarkantak, India (originally from Hassan, Karnataka). It is a new discovery that inaugurates the fundamental nature of the Universe, Human Being, Consciousness & Human purpose.\n\nThis is not based on any religious belief or sect, but on natural laws, on reality. This is an ‘existence based human focused contemplation’. This Coexistential Philosophy (Coexistentialism) is being presented as an ‘Alternative’ to Materialism(Science) and Theism/Spiritualism for evaluation and study by humankind.\n\nSalient Points\n\nThis philosophy is comprehensive.

This is due to partial-functioning in the conscious activities. It hence experiences unhappiness, conflict, discontentment, bondage and disorder ‘within’ & as an individual, in family, society & between nation-states.\nThe full ‘awakening‘ .of all faculties in the conscious atom (jeevan) results in fulfillment in the conscious self & in human living. I.e. The conscious atom (jeevan) itself becomes awakened to reality, and in human living, experiences order, happiness, contentment & freedom ‘within’, thus expressing & enabling order ‘outside’ as individuals, families, society & nation-states.\nNature is in intrinsic Order. Existence is Stable. Progress & evolution (in matter) and awakening (in conscious atom) are definite.\nThe human purpose is to understand the above, behold this knowledge and live expressing this Order.\nRead More\nImplications of this Discovery for us Humans\n+\nA new direction to Human Enquiry\n+"

One variety preached, while the other committed to exploitation & war. Human happiness can never be had whilst living in ‘Animal-Consciousness’.\n\nThis is only possible via Consciousness Development, which needs Knowledge, Wisdom & Science (ज्ञान विवेक विज्ञान). The current human living, education, justice, culture & constitutions is a reflection of under-developed consciousness. Consumerism (bhog) & Renunciation (tyag) have not worked for humankind.\n\n– A. Nagraj\n\n~\n\nMay Earth be Heaven, May humans be god-like.\nMay Dharma* get realized, May Goodness arise always.\n\n~\n\nHuman-beings found at present on this Earth, which is a part of one among infinite galaxies in the all pervasive Space (Void), are extremely fortunate, because they have the golden opportunity and means for studying and experimenting progression and regression in existence.\n\nAbhyudaya (all-round resolution) is inspiring everyone everywhere that – “Appraise yourself, so that you will not make mistakes or commit crimes, and as a result you will never be unhappy, distraught, or deprived.”\n\nFor appraising oneself, the following naturally-evident fundamentals are required to be internalized, and these are: –\n\nEarth is One (undivided-nation) – Nation-states are Many.\nHuman race is One – Human-actions are Many.\nHuman Religion is One – Resolutions are Many.\nGod* (Omnipresence) is One – Divine-beings** are Many.\n(* translator note: God = Space, or Void. Space is all-pervasive, and hence Omnipresence. We can call ‘Space’ by any name, one such name is God. ‘God’ is not an ‘activity’. Space itself is energy-in-equilibrium and hence given the name ‘Omnipotence’. In this sense, ‘Space’ can be called ‘God’. **Divine-beings: Conscious units that have the knowledge & conduct of human-consciousness, super-human consciousness)\nThis Proposal\nIs so that every human know the other human as a unit (in orderliness) and fulfill the relationship with him accordingly – to develop such potential, ability, and receptivity,\nIs for natural continuity of coexistence, balance, resolution, fearlessness, and happiness,\nIs for becoming capable of living resolutely with righteous-wealth (having only what is rightfully one’s own), righteous marital-relationship (being faithful in marital life), and work-behaviour with kindness,\nIs for finding a simple-path to move from inhumanness to humanness, and from humanness towards super-humanness,\nIs for fulfilling one’s responsibilities in undivided-society and universal-orderliness in a natural manner,\nIs so that knowledge and cherished humane culture and civilization can be evidenced,\nThis proposal is for developing culture and civilization of humanness in the Nation (all of Earth)\n\nIn order to make the above study easily available to all, I experience great happiness while handing over the first part of Madhyasth-Darshan Sah-astitva-vad under the title Manav Vyavhar Darshan to entire humankind. (Manav Vyavhaar Darshan = Realistic-view or darshan of Human-behaviour)\n\n~\n\nI fully trust that after studying the facts indicated here, this book will inspire you for instilling humane perspective, properties (qualities), and tendencies in your behaviour and it will help in development of your personality. Whereby:–\n\nEarth itself will become heaven, Humans themselves will become god-like. Dharma will get realized, And only good will happen always.\n\n– A. Nagraj, 1977\n\n(* Note: Dharma = Religion = Inseparability = Innateness.

We want to be happy, be peaceful, contented, etc.\nThe outcome of Study is ‘consciousness transformation’ or awakening. When we are awakened we can ‘see’ the natural order of everything that exists. We thus have a resolution (samadhan) for all states we live in. This is happiness.\nWe thus live in ‘human-consciousness’, express our awakening, happiness and humane-conduct. This is our ultimate goal, the human goal.\nObjective of Study\nThe objective of Study is transformation from ‘animal consciousness’ to ‘human consciousness’:\nFreedom from wrongful mentality (अपराध बुद्धि)\nFreedom from Illusion, via Knowledge of reality\nLiving with humaneness – with feelings such as trust, affection, care and love in our relationships\nParticipation: ensuring we promote an undivided human society and natural world order\nExperience and express happiness, peace, contentment & joy as a result of the above.\n\nThe approach to Study of Madhyasth Darshan consists of 2 broad Phases:\n\nPhase#1: Preliminary evaluation to ascertain one's seriousness\n\nThe first step is ‘Preliminary Evaluation’ to clear our doubts. We test the need and validity of the proposal for ourselves and all of humanity. We start by attending introductory workshops.\n\nWe evaluate this proposal via Scrutiny, Examination & Survey (निरीक्षण, परीक्षण, सर्वेक्षण) in the workshops, discussions and reading of the books and finding that it fulfills our need & conditions for knowing & living.\n\nThere are 4 Parameters for Testing the validity of this proposal through-out the process of study:\n\nUniversal for all places & people (naturally acceptable to me, rational, experiential)\nPerennial – for all time (natural to existence)\nLivable: (harmony with humans and nature)\nCommunicable: from one human to another\n\nThis phase thus convinces us to commit ourselves wholly to this endeavour or ‘way of life’.\n\nPhase#2: Study & Practice (अध्ययन और अभ्यास)\n\nOnce doubts have been cleared in the ‘preliminary evaluation’, and we don’t have any other alternatives for knowing and living, we commit ourselves to serious Study & Practice of the proposal.\nThis broadly consists of:\n\nI) Practice of Textual Study\nSystematic study & understanding of the subject matter in the Literature in a logically–consistent manner\nGet an intellectual-view of the nature of Reality, and the basic program for a Human\nII) Practice in Humane Living\nWe practice the laws of living we've understood in our daily life.\nThese include righteousness in wealth, marital life (chastity) and kindness in behaviour.\nWe recognise the relationships we live - in family and beyond, and fulfil them.\nIII) Practice Meditation/Reflection\nThis is a process of distillation where we derive inferences from our Study & Practice in Living\nWe strive to continually focus on the realities we seek to have knowledge of our conscious-self and its many faculties or activities, of the various dimensions of reality/existence, and of humane conduct or living.\nThis process leads to gradual clarity as glimpse (bhaas) and semblance (abhaas) in understanding and living.\nOur success is in being able to have direct-perception (sakshatkar) of such realities\nSuch clarity or insight enables an evolving transformation in our level of consciousness.\nWhat Study is not\nStudy (adhyayan) is not merely a ‘bookish’ exercise to be done on a desk. Study takes place with a competent person, a teacher – in whom the meanings of words reside as ‘knowledge of reality’.\nThis is not merely an ‘intellectual exercise’, but one that manifests in living and necessitates investigation of & living in human-relationships and relationship with the rest of nature.\nThis is not a ‘part-time’ pursuit. Serious study – (in order to become awakened, complete with knowledge) requires full time commitment to Study and Practice and needs changes in lifestyle and our perspectives (drishti).\nThe study of reality according to Madhyasth Darshan does not include any ‘prevalent meditative-practices’; ‘need to close ones eyes’, ‘chanting’ or ‘mystical-experiences’.\nMadhyasth Darshan does not derive from other darshans or philosophies. This is being mentioned here in order to avoid confusing this with existing theories, where the words used are similar, but with a totally different intended meaning.\n\nshriram n | student | jan 2016"

    "content": "Resource Center\nStart Adhyayan\nMethod Of Study\nExplained\nResource Center\nStart Adhyayan\nWatch Audio Video\nDownload Resources\nConnect to Community\nMethod of Study (Adhyayan Vidhi)\n\nRead the basic introduction to Study and Practice first\n\nWhat is Study\n\nDownload following article as PDF.\n\nThe objective of study & practice is to have the understanding, or answers to every why, what and how. This is called resolution or samadhan. 'Resolution' is possible via transformation to human consciousness & awakening, that results in happiness, peace, satisfaction & bliss.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe method consists of Study (अध्ययन) & Practice (अभ्यास) that takes one through the four following\nstages or grounds:\n\nStage 1. Theoretical Understanding\nWe systematically study the literature to access the underlying meanings denoted. The meanings cover\nthe Conscious Self (jeevan),\nExistence (astitva darshan),\nHumane Conduct (manveey aacharan) and\nHumane Order (akhand samaj, sarvabhoum vyavastha).\nVia a process of repeated study, we use logical analysis & comparison of different concepts to get a 'composite-view' of the different aspects of reality, the conscious self (jeevan) & the program for a human (awakening-progression & awakening).\nAt some point, we commit to refocus our lives wholly for this pursuit of the Human Goal (manav ka karykram), of the goal of the conscious self (jeevan ka karykram).\nWe notice gross level changes in our selves, our goals for life and living.\nWe get a wholesome 'view' that mimics all aspects of reality - the material, conscious and spatial in their gross, subtle & causal dimensions.\nWe are convinced about the validity of the proposal, the path, & ability to have the understanding oneself.\nWe choose a favourable environment where we can pursue this further: place, people (fraternity),\nprogram and larger-purpose.\nAt this stage, our 'understanding' is largely dependent on words. This is where we reconfirm our beliefs or shravan.\nThis stage is called listening or viewing in or via the mind or shravan.\nStage 2. Focusing & Implementation in Living\nWe further focus on the theoretical understanding obtained to get a distilled view of the different dimensions of reality, to get its semblance. This includes research and cross-referencing across the entire body of literature.\nThese distilled 'inferences' or nishkarsh, are now as meanings, supported by words. We check and recheck our inferences and shravan for 'confirmation bias' (believing our own beliefs to be true!)\nWe now become involved with these meanings, we implement these inferences in our daily life:\nWe identify the various conscious activities in ourselves via self-scrutiny and observation\nWe deploy these inferences or acceptances in our conduct - in living with humans and in work with nature.\nWe thus practice laws such as non-accumulation, righteous wealth, chastity in marital life, kindness, trust, care, generosity, identifying & fulfilling relationships etc. in daily life,\nAt the same time we identify and let go of undesirable traits in us.\nThis help develop the associated feelings (bhavas) in us\nThis repeated process thus makes our inferences come 'alive', further sharpening them with subtle interconnections and refining the picture/cognition we have. We now are able to deliberate or judge on the basis of a total semblance of the realities of justice-religion & truth (nyaya dharma satya).\nMaturity in this stage of practice demands a high degree of internal honesty, objectivity, purity, humility & acceptance of coexistential bhavas.\nWe achieve a basic (wavering) level of 'retention' of our mental faculties on these meanings resident in our mind (citta or psyche). We begin to identify the gross & subtle dimensions of conscious (jeevan) activities and external realities and experience interrupted (semblance) of happiness & peace (sukh, shanti)\nBased on the clarity from such retention & results we get in daily life, we now have the highest intense desire to 'see' these realities ourselves and achieve continuity in our state of contentment.\nThis stage is called Reflection, Meditation, or manan. Here, the object of knowing & living is fixated in our mind or citta, and the activities of analysis and tasting in the mun follow suit.\nStage 3. Establishment via Confirmation & Practice\nWhen the previous practice gives rise to an intense concentration of our mental faculties, we are able to get confirmation of the inferences we have distilled.\nThis happens when we have direct-perception or direct-knowledge of the realities related to any one or more of these inferences.\nThis direct-perception is beyond, or devoid of word and logic. It reveals the associated reality and hence confirms the earlier inferences that were supported by word & logic. This is the beginning of 'knowing'.\nThis results in immutable contemplative-knowledge of first the subtle and then the causal activities in the conscious self (jeevan) & corresponding dimensions of external reality that is continuous and un-erasable. This is also called profound meditation or niddhiyasan.\nAs a result of such knowledge, we become committed to live according to the knowledge gained and strive to bring it in practice and complete our knowledge of the remaining realities via further concentration or focus to achieve unwavering retention.\nThis cyclical process of concentration & behavioural practice leads to a state of 'Fixity' in humane conduct and the experience of developed human consciousness. It doesn't 'move' or 'shake' any more.\nWe now experience a retention in our experience of happiness, peace and contentment (sukh, shanti, santosh).\nThis stage is called sakshatkar leading to avdharna. This is 'Study' or Adhyayan that has resulted from the previous Practices, or 'arms of adhyayan'.\nStage 4. Comprehension & Realization - Concentration\nOnce we have complete mastery over the Establishment or Fixity in developed human consciousness & humane living, we further concentrate our faculties on its essential value or meaning and refine our behaviour & conduct to include Love, or complete acceptance.\nWhen this replacing is achieved, we have knowledge about the causal-dimensions of ones conscious self (jeevan), of spatial reality (vyapak, shunya) & the innate nature of external reality (dharma). This is a spiritual accomplishment.\nThis is the 'balance' in knowing and believing & called Comprehension or Bodh, leading to further fineness & abilities in living, followed by final Realization.\nRealization (or Spiritual Experience) means complete acceptance of the existence of, and fundamental relationship between spatial reality (satya) and all (causal, subtle & gross) dimensions of conscious and material realities. This is called anubhav.\nThis is the contentment point of knowing & believing. There is nothing left to be 'known'.\nWe then live accordingly, variously expressing justice, religion & truth (nyaya, dharma, satya) – evidencing Human, Godly & Divine Consciousness (मानव, देव मानव, दिव्य मानव प्रमाणित होता).\n\nTheory\n\nA theoretical overview of the method of study (adhyayan prakriya) is given below.\n\nDefinition of Practice (अभ्यास)\nIntellectual, Spoken & bodily activities for obtaining the answer to Why? and What?\nDefinition of Study: (अध्ययन)\n\"Becoming in the form of the truth or tadakaar: Our imagination becoming in the form of, attuned to the meanings indicated by words\", in the form of realities, itself is becoming tadakaar (tadakaar hona - शब्द के अर्थ में स्वयं में आत्मा में वास्तविक रूप होने)\n.[word given in madhyastha darshan]\nThe combined procedure of listening, meditation & direct-perception is adhyayan (श्रवण मनन निदिध्यासन को संयुक्त प्रक्रिया ही अध्ययन है)\n\nStudy and Practice go together. Study itself is Practice\n\nWe deploy our faculty of imagination envisioning & thoughts to understand Reality. We use our ability of knowledge-perspective, or knowledge-cognition (gyan drishti, gochar) instead of the sensory-perspective or sensory-cognition (chakshu drishti, gochar) for our study. This is essential to understand the 'formless' dimensions of reality.\n\nWe progress through the following four stages or grounds in our Study & Practice:\n\nGround 1: Listening (श्रवण) → (Acceptance & Understanding)\nLiterature Study-Practice (साहित्य-अध्ययन-प्रक्रिया)\nGlimpse of Reality (संभावना): \"Acceptance of the meaning of the written and spoken word – the ultimate truth of Coexistence coming in imagination\".

See definitions.\nThe objectives, method & outcomes of study in madhyasth darshan does not derive from or based on Vedanta, the YogaSutras or Buddhism, etc. Terms may be similar or have some overlaps.\nStages 1, 2 & 3 above are both sequential and cyclical. Success in Study needs guidance from a living competent human being, that has this understanding.\n\nSee Guidance for Study for suggestion on how to proceed.\n\n-shriram n | student | june 2013 | updated - January 2017 | revised - February 2022"

Reading & Analysis is the first step in the Study Process.\nStudy & Practice also involves ‘Self-Evaluation’ and ‘Living accordingly‘:\nas Behavior (Vyavaharabhyas) & fulfillment of relationships with other Humans (in Family, friends, etc) and\n‘Work’ with the rest of nature. (Karmabhyas)\nPractice of ‘Living’ according to ‘intellectual-law’(बौद्धिक नियम), social-law(सामाजिक नियम) and natural-law(प्राकृतिक नियम) is an integral part of Practice. Read the method of study\nMeet & Sharing with people – सामाजिकता\n‘Adhyayan’ or Study is not an ‘isolated’ exercise. While reading and other media are important, guidance is ultimately only from a Human Being (Teacher) who has understood, hence it is important to be in touch with a competent person you feel can guide you.\nYou may want to ‘share’ what you have ‘learned/ understood’ with others – via small discussions or even conducting full-introductory shivirs yourself. Keep in mind that we are doing this for ‘our practice’, and to ‘test & deepen’ our own understanding. Not to ‘change the world’. The world will be properly benefited, only when we are ourselves complete, have had ‘Understanding’ ourselves. Sharing what we have learned benefits the world anyways. Hence, this is not primarily a ‘social change’ program. Rather, it is a process of having knowledge and living with humane-conduct ourselves, and change percolating to others via our own understanding & living.\nNot ‘Mixing’ – बिना मिलावट का अध्ययन\nThe study of reality according to Madhyasth Darshan does not include any ‘prevalent meditative-practices’, ‘need to close ones eyes’, ‘chanting’ or ‘mystical-experiences’.\n‘Madhyasth Darshan’ does not derive from, nor related to Vedanta, the YogaSutras by Sage Patanjali, Buddhism or any other Darshan in any way, albeit one will find many similar sounding words and overlapping concepts.\nThis is being mentioned here in order to avoid confusing this with existing theories, where the words like ‘Shravan, Manan, Nididhyasan’, etc used are similar, but with a totally different intended meaning.\n‘Study’ also does not mean ‘comparative studies’ with other philosophies/darsanas\nHence, Madhyasth Darshan needs to be studied and practiced in its own right, and not on the basis of any current / past practice, or some ‘hybrid-method’ we may come up with.\nThe method to achieve anything is provided by one who has crossed that path, not the student that is on the path himself.\n\n~\n\n** Remember, stick to the ‘Original Guidance’ by Shri Nagarj in matters related to adhyayan vidhi and jeevan jagriti!\n\n~\n\nshriram n | student | jan 2013 – updated Feb 2022"

The study journey has been briefed here. This takes time.\n\nThere are mainly four phases in the study. Each phase has some 'steps', passing through which, completes the understanding of that phase.\n\nLevel 1: Primary Foundation\nIn this phase, the ability to read texts is developed by becoming aware of the basic elements of Madhyasth Darshan philosophy\nConsists of 3 stages {Introduction Workshop, Adhyayan Bindu (Basic Concepts), & Overview (Avlokan)}\nLevel 2: Systematic Study/ Adhyayan. (Shravana)\nIn this phase, the basic texts of philosophy are read and understood\nConsists of 2 stages {Book reading + Repetitions & with discussion groups (goshthis)}\nLevel 3: Systematic Practice. (Manana)\nIn this phase the practice intensifies leading to internal transformation.\nConsists of 1 stage {Practice}\nLevel 4: Understanding & Knowledge (Sakshatkara)\nIn this phase, the realities are known directly\nConsists of 3 stages (Realization-Understanding-Experience)\n\nThe guide contains the description of each phase/step, possible benefits (symptoms) . This English version does not contain the study material-links for each stage. Please download the hindi margdarshika below:\n\n~ Primary Foundation Level (3 Stages) ~\nStage#1\nStage#2\nStage#3\nCourse/Stage #1: Jeevan Vidya Parichay\n\nThe Madhyastha Darshan journey begins with the seven-day Jeevan Vidya Parichay Camp. The Jeevan Vidya Parichay Camp gives information about the complete dimensions of human life and all situations. The mysteries related to these are eliminated, along with making the path of solution clear. It is suggested that you attend Parichay camps by more than one Prabodhak. This stage may take 6 months to 1 year.\n\n~ Systematic Study Level (2 Stages) ~\nStage#4\nStage#5\nCourse/Stage #4: First round of reading the 12 books\n\nMadhyastha Darshan Study (Adhyayan) Shivir is a systematic study of 12 books (4 philosophies or darshans, 3 'isms & 3 shastras (scriptures), the book on definitions and human constitution). In this, a senior student explains the teachings and it can be completed on full time or part time basis. Complete information about understanding, living, humane system and tradition is revealed and the mind is prepared to understand and live it further. Study camps are available from 6 months to 2 years, in full and part time modes.\n\n~ Systematic Practice Level ~\nStage#6\nCourse/Stage #6: Manana\n\nAfter having 'understood' the entire literature, the manana phase is for focusing on becoming what one has understood, to become knowledgeable oneself. Detailed discussions take place on the aspects of ones internal and external behavior, self-evaluation and understanding. In this phase, language reduces, while 'meaning' increases. It takes many years to attain maturity in manan, and this depends on our previous sanskar and intense desire to change ourselves.\n\n~ Understanding Level (3 Stages) ~\nStage#7,8,9\nSakshatkara, Bodh, Anubhava\n\nIn sakshatkara, we have direct perception of the realities that we have previously understood & contemplated on. We get knowledge of the unchanging realities that exist in existence. There is no language and logic, due to realization, there is faith in the entity understood and commitment to live accordingly. Once we have sakshatkara, the books/words start getting left behind. The stability of avdharna takes time in the process of sakshatkara & bodh. It depends on our previous sanskaar and our intense desire.As we have avdharna, all inhumane and prohibited behaviour is left behind. It gives rise to the knowledge of developed consciousness.In bodh, there is firmness on the things that have been realized. The book gets left behind.In the sakshatkara-bodh process, one starts achieving rest, happiness & peace, contentment in the self. There is continuity of joy based after anubhava.Knowledge and conduct get complete in anubhava.\n\nDownload PDF of the Journey with detailed explanation of each Stage in English."

But what if that feeling is just a glimpse of something far more stable?\n\nThis workshop proposes that true, unconditional Love (Prem) is the pinnacle of understanding—the final value that emerges from a fully awakened consciousness (जीवन). It is the complete acceptance that arises when we see ourselves in all others, rooted in the realization of Co-existence (सह-अस्तित्व). It is the combined expression of compassion, grace, and mercy (दया, कृपा, करुणा).\n\nUnlike fleeting emotions, this Love is not a transaction. It is a stable state (भाव) that radiates from within once we are free from our own inner contradictions. The journey begins with Affection (स्नेह), which is the feeling of being non-opposed to another and is the foundation of justice (न्याय).\n\nCould it be that the lasting love we seek is not something to be found in another, but an understanding to be developed within our own consciousness (जीवन)?\n\nOn Happiness (सुख)\n\nYou've been chasing happiness your whole life; what if it was already inside you, waiting to be understood?\n\nOur entire life is a series of pursuits for happiness, believing it lies in the next achievement, the next purchase, or another person's approval. We experience temporary pleasure through our senses (इन्द्रिय सुख), but it never lasts, leaving us chasing the next thing. This is the cycle of a deluded (भ्रमित) human being.\n\nWhat if this chase is the very thing keeping us from happiness? This workshop proposes that human beings are naturally सुखधर्मी (their innate nature is to be happy). True, continuous happiness is not an external reward; it's an internal state of being. It is the result of Resolution (समाधान)—a state where all our \"whys\" and \"hows\" about life are answered, and our inner contradictions cease.\n\nThis workshop presents four states of being: Happiness (सुख), Peace (शांति), Contentment (संतोष), and Bliss (आनंद). These are not random feelings but the precise, experiential outcomes of harmony within our own consciousness (जीवन)—between our Mind (मन), Intellect (वृत्ति), Deeper Conscience (चित्त), and Self (आत्मा).\n\nThe question then isn't \"how to get happiness,\" but \"what is the lack of understanding within me that is blocking my natural state of being happy?\"\n\nOn Marriage (विवाह)\n\nBeyond rituals, adjustments, and compromise, have you discovered the real purpose of being married together?\n\nSociety often frames marriage as a social contract full of duties, adjustments, and compromises. We focus on the external aspects, but often miss the profound purpose of this relationship.\n\nThis workshop proposes that marriage (पति-पत्नी संबंध) is a pivotal relationship for mutual development towards a shared goal: awakening (जागृति). The ultimate achievement in a marriage is described as becoming \"one mind and two bodies\" (एक मन और दो शरीर), where there is such deep harmony in understanding that you act as a single, resolved unit.\n\nThis is not achieved through compromise, but through mutual fulfillment based on clearly defined values like Trust (विश्वास), Respect (सम्मान), and Affection (स्नेह). It's a relationship where you help each other resolve your inner confusions and contradictions, creating an environment of harmony that becomes the foundation for a resolved family and society.\n\nHave we seen our marriage as a journey of mutual self-discovery, or as a set of lifelong adjustments where both individuals slowly lose their sense of self?\n\nOn Relationship (संबंध)\n\nTired of managing expectations? Have you ever thought about what are the universally right expectations of humans that needs no management?\n\nMost of our exhaustion in relationships comes from managing a web of undefined and often conflicting expectations. We expect others to behave as we want, and they expect the same from us, leading to constant friction and disappointment.\n\nThis workshop proposes that relationships are not meant to be \"managed.\" They are meant to be recognized (पहचानना) and fulfilled (निर्वाह करना). It identifies definite relationships (like parent-child, friends, partners) and the inherent, universal values (मूल्य) within them, such as Trust (विश्वास), Respect (सम्मान), Gratitude (कृतज्ञता), and Affection (स्नेह).\n\nThese values are not arbitrary; they are the natural expectation of every human Jeevan (consciousness). When we understand and live with these values, the need for \"management\" dissolves. Fulfillment becomes effortless. For example, trust is the assurance that the other person wants my happiness. Once I can see this and ensure this for the other, trust becomes the stable foundation.\n\nSo, the question shifts from \"How do I manage this person?\" to \"Do I understand the inherent values in this relationship and am I able to fulfill them?\"\n\nOn Good Parenting (सही परवरिश)\n\nYou give your child good education for their career, but have you given them the clarity to understand life themselves?\n\nAs parents, our primary focus is often on providing the best—the best schools, the best facilities, the best opportunities for a successful career. We try to impart good values (संस्कार), but often through instructions and rules.\n\nThis workshop asks a deeper question: What is the purpose of parenting? Is it to create a successful professional, or a resolved, happy human being? The text suggests that the highest duty of a parent (माता-पिता) is to provide an environment where a child can develop Right Understanding (ज्ञान) and Right Feeling/Resolution (समाधान). This involves helping them understand themselves (the जीवन and the शरीर), their relationships, and their role in the larger existence.\n\nA child learns not from our words, but from our being. If we ourselves are living in confusion (भ्रम), anxiety, and contradiction, can we truly provide an environment of clarity and fearlessness (अभय) for them? The greatest gift we can give our children is our own resolved state of being—our own जागृति (awakening).\n\nAre we preparing our children just for a livelihood, or for life itself?\n\nOn Spirituality (अध्यात्म)\n\nWhat if spirituality wasn't about leaving the world, but about understanding what is my role in it?\n\nSpirituality is often equated with renunciation, rituals, or the search for a mystical experience, separate from our daily lives. This creates a conflict between our \"spiritual\" and \"worldly\" duties.\n\nThis workshop redefines spirituality (अध्यात्म) not as an escape, but as a direct engagement with reality. It is the process of understanding existence (अस्तित्व) as it is. The core spiritual inquiry is to understand the Self (जीवन ज्ञान), to understand the whole of existence (अस्तित्व दर्शन ज्ञान), and to understand how to live in harmony with it (मानवीयतापूर्ण आचरण ज्ञान).\n\nIt isn’t about seeking a \"divine\" that is separate from reality. The divine is in the perfect order and harmony of co-existence itself (सह-अस्तित्व). Spirituality, then, is the journey from a state of illusion (भ्रम) to a state of awakening (जागृति), while living fully in the family and society. It is the path to resolving our inner conflicts so we can live with fulfillment and contribute to the universal order.\n\nTrue spirituality isn't about looking up at the heavens, but about looking at existence—inwards and outwards —with total clarity.\n\nOn God (ईश्वर)\n\nInstead of just praying to a higher power, what if you could understand the perfect order of existence itself?\n\nHumanity has long prayed to, feared, and sought favors from a personal God. This belief has often been rooted in mystery and the unexplainable.\n\nThis workshop offers a perspective that demystifies this concept. It proposes that what we call God (ईश्वर) or the Supreme Being is not a person, but the all-pervading, omnipresent reality (व्यापक वस्तु or सत्ता) in which all of nature—all matter and all conscious units—is submerged, energized, and controlled. Vyapak is a non-active, transparent, energy-filled \"emptiness\" or \"space\" that inspires all activity to happen in a perfectly regulated, orderly way.\n\nInstead of a “supreme creator” entire existence is seen as a co-existence with inherent, unchangeable laws of nature (नियम)—the perfect order that governs everything from atoms to galaxies. Instead of praying to an entity for intervention, the proposal is to understand this universal order (व्यवस्था) and align our own lives with it. This alignment, born of knowledge, is what leads to harmony and fulfillment.\n\nCould it be that the security we seek from God is actually found in understanding the infallible system of co-existence in which we are already participating?\n\nOn Money (पैसा)\n\nYou know how to earn money, but do you know the simple secret to feeling prosperous regardless of your bank balance?\n\nOur society equates money with security and happiness. This leads to a life of endless accumulation, because the feeling of \"enough\" is never reached. This is a core sign of a deluded (भ्रमित) life.\n\nThis workshop makes a critical distinction between Wealth (धन) and Prosperity (समृद्धि). Wealth is the accumulation of physical facilities. Prosperity, however, is a feeling of resolution that comes from having more than is required for your physical needs.\n\nThe key insight is this: our physical needs are limited and can be identified. When we identify our needs and produce or acquire more than that, we have the feeling of prosperity. A person with ten crores can feel deprived, while a person with one lakh can feel prosperous, if they have the right understanding of their needs. Prosperity is a state of mind, not a number in an account. Money (अर्थ) is merely a tool for facilitating the exchange of physical goods; it is not the source of happiness.\n\nThe real question is not \"how much money is enough?\" but \"have I correctly identified my needs?\" Once needs are identified, the path to feeling prosperous becomes clear and achievable.\n\nOn Motivation (प्रेरणा)\n\nWhy rely on temporary motivation from outside when a permanent inspiration can be awakened within?\n\nWe constantly seek external motivation—from speeches, books, or the approval of others. This motivation is like a spark that quickly dies out, leaving us needing another fix. It's an unstable foundation for life.\n\nThis workshop points to a source of permanent inspiration (प्रेरणा) that comes from within. This inspiration is not a fleeting emotion but is born from clarity of purpose. When we understand our true goal as a human being—which is to achieve a state of continuous happiness through awakening (जागृति) and co-existence (सह-अस्तित्व)—all our actions become aligned with that purpose.\n\nThe source of inspiration (प्रेरणा स्रोत) for all positive actions in an awakened human is the experience of knowledge itself (ज्ञान). When you have Resolution (समाधान), you are no longer pushed and pulled by external circumstances. Your actions flow effortlessly from your understanding. This inner alignment provides a steady, unwavering drive that external motivation can never match.\n\nAre we living our lives based on temporary boosts from the outside, or from a deep, unshakable clarity on the inside?\n\nOn Emotions (भावनाएं)\n\nAre you driven by your emotions, or have you learned to be the master of your inner world?\n\nFor most of us, our days are a rollercoaster of emotions. We feel happy when things go our way, angry or sad when they don't. We are often slaves to these reactions, which are tied to our sensory experiences and deluded beliefs (प्रियाप्रिय, हिताहित, लाभालाभ). This is the state of being driven by the body and the external world.\n\nThis workshop explains that our inner world—our consciousness (जीवन)—has a definite structure. In a state of delusion (भ्रम), our mind (which interfaces with the body's senses) is driven by sensory gratification and the need for external validation, leading to chaotic emotions and reactions.\n\nMastery comes when a harmony is achieved within our consciousness. The Self (आत्मा), through the faculty of the True Intellect (बुद्धि), guides our deeper thoughts (चित्त) and intellect (वृत्ति), which in turn guide the mind (मन). When our feelings and actions originate from a place of clear understanding (ज्ञान) rather than sensory reactions, we become the master of our inner world. Our feelings become stable values like trust, respect, and affection, rather than reactive emotions.\n\nAre our feelings the result of what happens to us, or the result of the understanding that exists in us?\n\nOn Desire (इच्छा)\n\nYour desires are endless, but have you ever investigated where they truly come from?\n\nWe live in a state of endless desire (इच्छा). The moment one is fulfilled, another takes its place. This is because, in a state of delusion (भ्रम), our desires are primarily driven by sensory gratification and the need for external validation. We believe that fulfilling these desires will bring happiness, but it only leads to a temporary pause in our restlessness.\n\nThis workshop invites us to investigate the root of desire. Desires originate in the चित्त (the faculty of imagination and deeper conscience) within our consciousness (जीवन). In a deluded state, our चित्त is constantly creating images of what it thinks will bring pleasure, based on past sensory experiences and borrowed ideas from society.\n\nHowever, in an awakened state (जागृति), our इच्छा becomes aligned with our true, natural goal: the desire for continuous happiness through resolution (समाधान) and co-existence (सह-अस्तित्व). The randomness of desire is replaced by a clear, singular, and fulfilling purpose.\n\nAre our desires truly our own, or are they just random, unexamined imaginations controlling our lives?\n\nOn Liberation (मुक्ति/मोक्ष)\n\nTrue moksha isn't freedom from the world, but freedom from your own confusion and realising your true purpose while living in it.\n\nThe concept of Liberation (मोक्ष) has often been misunderstood as an escape from life, relationships, and worldly responsibilities. This creates a false dichotomy between living in the world and being free.\n\nThis workshop powerfully reframes moksha as freedom from illusion (भ्रम मुक्ति). The bondage is not the world; the bondage is our own ignorance (अज्ञान) and the internal contradictions it creates. The primary illusion is believing we are just this physical body (शरीर) and that happiness comes from sensory gratification.\n\nLiberation, therefore, is an internal shift. It is the attainment of Right Understanding (ज्ञान) of what reality is, who \"I\" (the जीवन) am, and my purpose in the grand scheme of co-existence. A liberated person (जागृत मानव) does not run away from the world. They live fully within family and society, but their actions are rooted in resolution (समाधान) and harmony, not confusion and reaction. They are free from the internal suffering caused by anger, fear, and ego, and their presence helps others on the path to their own liberation.\n\nMoksha is not an after-death destination; it is the state of being fully awakened, resolved, and harmonious while living this very life.\n\nOn Rebirth (पुनर्जन्म)\n\nBefore worrying about the next life, have you truly understood the 'Self' that is living this one?\n\nThe idea of rebirth often leads to speculation about past lives and future destinations, distracting us from the life we are living right now.\n\nThis workshop brings the focus squarely back to the present. It explains that the \"I\" or the Self (जीवन) is a conscious, atomic unit that is eternal (अमरत्वधर्मा). The body (शरीर) is a temporary, physical instrument that the जीवन uses. The death of the body is a certainty (शरीर का नश्वरत्व), but the जीवन continues its journey (जीवन का अमरत्व).\n\nThe state of the जीवन—its accumulated understandings and unresolved illusions (संस्कार)—is what carries forward. The journey of the जीवन through different bodies is a journey towards Awakening (जागृति). Therefore, the most critical task is not to worry about what body we will get next, but to work on resolving our illusions and developing right understanding in this life. By achieving liberation from illusion (भ्रम मुक्ति) now, we break the cycle of confusion that perpetuates suffering across lifetimes.\n\nThe key to a better future life is to make this present life a fully understood and resolved one. Have we invested our energy in understanding the eternal Jeevan, or only in maintaining the temporary Sharir?\n\nOn Truth (सत्य)\n\nWe argue about what is truth?, but what if Truth was something not to be believed, but to understand our existence and our purpose in it?\n\nWe are taught to believe in certain truths—be they religious, scientific, or social. This often leads to dogma and conflict, as one person's belief clashes with another's.\n\nThis workshop presents Truth (सत्य) not as a belief system, but as reality as it is. The ultimate truth is Co-existence (सह-अस्तित्व)—the reality of all of nature (जड़-चैतन्य प्रकृति) being eternally submerged and energized within an all-pervading reality (व्यापक सत्ता). This is not something to be believed, but something to be known, understood, and experienced.\n\nTruth is not a statement; it is the very fabric of existence. The goal is to develop the capacity to see this reality directly, moving beyond belief (मान्यता) to knowledge (ज्ञान) and finally to experience (अनुभव).\n\nOn Consciousness (चेतना)\n\nHave you ever wondered what is consciousness? I am only this physical body or is there something beyond?\n\nThis is one of the most fundamental questions of human existence. Modern science often tries to explain consciousness as a product of the brain, while traditional views can be mystical.\n\nThis workshop provides a clear, logical and verifiable answer. It states that you are not just the body (शरीर). You are a conscious unit, the जीवन, which is an eternal, self-organized atomic entity (चैतन्य परमाणु). The body is your instrument, a complex biochemical machine, but the जीवन is the one that experiences, thinks, desires, and understands. It is the seer (दृष्टा), the doer (कर्ता), and the experiencer (भोक्ता).\n\nConsciousness (चेतना) itself is identified with the all-pervading reality (व्यापक वस्तु) in which the जीवन is submerged. The जीवन has the potential to realize its oneness with this all-pervading consciousness, which is the ultimate goal of awakening (जागृति). The journey of a human is a journey of consciousness development, moving from जीव चेतना (animal consciousness, focused on survival) to मानव चेतना (human consciousness, living with resolution and values) and ultimately to दिव्य चेतना (divine consciousness, experiencing co-existence).\n\nThe understanding that \"I am a conscious Jeevan, and the body is my instrument\" is the first and most crucial step towards self-realization and freedom from confusion (भ्रम).\n\nOn Mind (मन)\n\nWhere does mind exist? Is it a part of my brain? Is it a separate entity? how does it function?\n\nThe mind is often a mystery, thought to be somewhere in the brain, yet intangible. This workshop offers a clear model, placing the mind (मन) as a specific faculty of the conscious Self (जीवन), not the physical brain (मेधस).\n\nThe जीवन (consciousness) is described as having a structure of five interconnected faculties:\n\nमन (Mind): The faculty of tasting (आस्वादन) and selecting (चयन). It interfaces with the body's senses and seeks pleasurable sensations.\n\nवृत्ति (Intellect): The faculty of analyzing (विश्लेषण) and comparing (तुलन).\n\nचित्त (Deeper Conscience): The faculty of imagination/visualization (चित्रण) and contemplation (चिंतन). This is where desires take shape.\n\nबुद्धि (True Intellect): The faculty of determination and knowing (बोध) the truth.\n\nआत्मा (Self/Soul): The faculty of experiencing (अनुभव) reality as it is.\n\nThe brain (मेधस) is the physical hardware that the मन uses to receive signals from the senses and send commands to the body, but the मन itself is a non-physical activity of the जीवन. In a state of confusion, our मन acts as the master, chasing sensory pleasures. In an awakened state, the मन acts as a disciplined servant, guided by the higher faculties of वृत्ति, चित्त, and बुद्धि, leading to stable happiness instead of fleeting pleasure.\n\nOn Religion (धर्म)\n\nBeyond organised religion, have you explored the universal dharma of being human?\n\nReligion is often associated with specific communities, books, and rituals, which can become sources of division and conflict.\n\nThis workshop redirects the focus to the universal meaning of Dharma (धर्म). The Dharma of any entity is its intrinsic, inseparable nature—that which cannot be separated from it. For example, the dharma of a material object is to exist (अस्तित्व धर्म).\n\nWhat, then, is the Dharma of a human being? The text states that the Dharma of a human is to live in a state of continuous happiness (सुख). Just as a material object's nature is to exist, a human's nature is to be happy. All our struggles, desires, and actions are fundamentally driven by this singular, universal pursuit.\n\nLiving according to this Dharma means aligning our thoughts, behavior, and work to achieve this state of resolution-based happiness. This universal Dharma of seeking happiness through right understanding and harmonious living is common to all humans, irrespective of the organized religion they follow. This is the मानव धर्म (Human Religion).\n\nOn Laziness (आलस)\n\nIs it laziness, or is your inner self simply refusing to work without a clear purpose?\n\nWe often label our inaction or procrastination as laziness (आलस्य) and try to fight it with willpower. But what if it's a symptom of a deeper issue?\n\nThis workshop defines laziness as not doing a task even after accepting its rightness and utility. It's a state of internal conflict. It is proposed that the Self (जीवन) is inherently active and wants to express itself. However, when there is no clarity of purpose—when we don't understand why we are doing what we are doing—our inner self feels no inspiration to act.\n\nIf our work is not aligned with our natural desire for happiness through resolution, if it feels meaningless or is born out of fear and compulsion, our consciousness essentially rebels. The feeling we call \"laziness\" could be a powerful signal that our actions are disconnected from our core purpose. When a human being has a clear, inspiring goal—like achieving समाधान (resolution) and contributing to a harmonious व्यवस्था (order)—the energy to act flows naturally.\n\nIs the problem a lack of energy, or a lack of a purpose that is compelling enough to energize you?\n\nOn Ego (अहंकार)\n\nIs your 'I' your true self, or just a collection of assumptions you've never questioned?\n\nThe word \"ego\" (अहंकार) is often used to mean pride or arrogance. This workshop gives it a much more precise and fundamental meaning.\n\nअहंकार is the state of the Intellect (बुद्धि) when it is disconnected from the Self (आत्मा) and its ability to experience reality directly. In this state of delusion (भ्रम), the बुद्धि operates based on unexamined beliefs and assumptions (मान्यताएं) taken from society or based on sensory experiences. It is this collection of borrowed beliefs that creates the false sense of \"I\" or the ego.\n\nThis ego is the root of our problems. It's the \"I\" that believes \"I am this body,\" \"I am my possessions,\" \"I am superior/inferior,\" or \"My belief is the only truth.\" Because these assumptions are not aligned with reality, they inevitably lead to internal contradictions, conflict with others, and suffering. The true \"I\" is the जीवन—the eternal, conscious Self. The ego is the mask of false identities it wears.\n\nThe journey of awakening (जागृति) is the journey of dissolving this अहंकार by replacing borrowed beliefs with true understanding (ज्ञान) gained through self-exploration, until the बुद्धि is guided by the direct experience of the आत्मा.\n\nOn Inferiority (हीन भावना)\n\nFeeling inferior or superior is tiring; what if you could just be your natural, complete self?\n\nThe constant mental game of comparing ourselves to others—feeling superior to some and inferior to others—is exhausting. This entire spectrum of comparison is a symptom of a deluded state of being.\n\nThis workshop explains that these feelings stem from mistakenly identifying ourselves with temporary and variable things: our body (रूप), our physical strength (बल), our position or post (पद), and our wealth (धन). Since these are all variable and can be compared, we are trapped in the endless loop of अधिमूल्यन (over-evaluation), अवमूल्यन (under-evaluation), and निर्मूल्यन (devaluation) of ourselves and others. हीनता (inferiority) is explicitly defined as a form of inhumane nature (अमानवीय स्वभाव) alongside helplessness (दीनता) and cruelty (क्रूरता).\n\nThe way out is to shift our identity. What if you identified yourself not with these temporary attributes, but with your true self—the जीवन (consciousness)? The जीवन in every human being is fundamentally the same in its potential for understanding and happiness. When you see that every human has the same purpose and the same potential, the very basis for comparison dissolves.\n\nYou are no longer \"better than\" or \"worse than.\" You are simply a human being on a journey of awakening, and so is everyone else. In this understanding lies true self-acceptance and peace.\n\nOn Suffering (दुःख)\n\nAre others causing your suffering, or is it the storm of contradictions within you?\n\nIt's natural to blame our suffering (दुःख) on external factors—other people's actions, our circumstances, or just bad luck. This places us in the position of a victim, powerless to change our own state.\n\nThis workshop turns this perspective inward. It asserts that while external events can trigger pain or discomfort, the root of all suffering (दुःख, क्लेश) is our own internal state of illusion (भ्रम) and contradiction. A deluded person (भ्रमित मानव) is in a state of being at war with themselves. For example, your mind (मन) wants sensory pleasure, but your intellect (वृत्ति) knows it might be harmful. This inner conflict between the faculties of the जीवन is what manifests as suffering, anxiety, and restlessness.\n\nAn awakened person (जागृत मानव), whose inner faculties are in harmony and aligned with reality, does not experience suffering even in the face of challenging situations. They experience resolution (समाधान). The pain might be there for the body, but the जीवन remains stable and peaceful.\n\nTherefore, the path to ending suffering is not to change the world outside, but to resolve the contradictions and ignorance within.\n\nOn Depression & Anxiety (अवसाद और चिंता)\n\nIs it just a chemical 'locha', or a signal from your being that it's tired of living in confusion?\n\nWhile there can be physiological components to our mental states, this workshop encourages looking at the root cause in our consciousness (जीवन). From this perspective, states like anxiety, depression, and stress (तनाव, अवसाद) are the logical and inevitable outcomes of a life lived in delusion (भ्रम).\n\nWhen we live with unresolved contradictions (असंतोष, अशांति), a lack of clarity about our purpose, and a constant internal conflict between what we desire and what is real, our Jeevan is in a state of continuous turmoil. This inner chaos, this deep-seated dissatisfaction and lack of harmony, manifests as what we call depression and anxiety. These states are powerful signals that our way of living, thinking, and believing is out of sync with reality. They are the screams of a Jeevan that is tired of being fragmented and confused.\n\nThe solution, therefore, is not just to manage the symptoms, but to address the root cause: the lack of Resolution (समाधान). By pursuing right understanding and aligning our lives with the inherent order of existence, we can achieve an inner harmony that is the natural antidote to these states of suffering.\n\nOn War & Peace (युद्ध और शांति)\n\nHave you ever wondered about a world with zero possibility of war? What can we do to make this happen?\n\nWe think of war as a conflict between nations, fought with soldiers and weapons, and we seek peace through treaties and negotiations. But these external solutions have never created lasting peace.\n\nThis workshop posits that the war outside (युद्ध) is merely a large-scale projection of the war raging inside every human being. The root cause of conflict is the deluded (भ्रमित) human consciousness, which operates from a place of fear and a belief in separate, competing identities (my nation vs. your nation, my religion vs. yours). This \"us vs. them\" thinking, rooted in ignorance (अज्ञान), is what leads to violence.\n\nA world without war is only possible when a critical mass of individuals achieves inner peace. This inner peace is Resolution (समाधान)—a state of being free from internal contradictions. A resolved human being lives in Co-existence (सह-अस्तित्व). They see the fundamental oneness of the entire human race (मानव जाति एक) and the world as a single, undivided family (अखण्ड समाज). For such a person, war is an absurdity.\n\nTherefore, the work for world peace is not on the battlefield, but within our own consciousness. The path to a war-free world is through mass human awakening (जागृति).\n\nOn Social Conflict (सामाजिक संघर्ष)\n\nWe fight over our differences, but have we ever tried to understand our fundamental and universal human oneness?\n\nSocial conflict—based on caste, religion, class, or ideology—arises from one fundamental error: we identify ourselves and others with our differences. These differences are rooted in our beliefs (मत), our group affiliations (समुदाय), or the circumstances of our body's birth, all of which are temporary and superficial.\n\nThis workshop states unequivocally that the human race is one (मानव जाति एक). While our bodies, beliefs, and customs may differ, the conscious Self (जीवन) within every person is fundamentally the same. Every human being has the same innate faculties (Mind, Intellect, etc.), the same potential for awakening, and the same ultimate goal: to achieve continuous happiness through resolution (समाधान).\n\nWhen we lack this understanding, we operate from समुदाय चेतना (community consciousness), where our identity is tied to our group, leading to \"us vs. them\" conflicts. The solution is to elevate ourselves to मानव चेतना (human consciousness), where we see the universal human characteristics first and foremost.\n\nThe path to resolving social conflict is not about ignoring our differences, but about realizing that our shared, fundamental oneness is far more profound and real.\n\nOn Climate Change (जलवायु परिवर्तन)\n\nIs climate change an environmental crisis, or is it a crisis of lack of fundamental human understanding?\n\nWe typically see climate change as a technical problem of emissions and resource depletion, to be solved with new technology and policies. But these only address the symptoms.\n\nThis workshop points to a much deeper root cause: a crisis in human consciousness. The environmental crisis is a direct result of a deluded (भ्रमित) relationship with nature. This delusion has two main aspects:\n\nThe Belief in Unlimited Consumption: We mistakenly believe that happiness comes from accumulating and consuming physical things. This leads to an insatiable desire for more (संग्रह कामना), driving the exploitation (शोषण) of natural resources far beyond what is needed.\n\nA Sense of Separation from Nature: We see nature as a separate \"resource\" to be conquered and used, rather than seeing ourselves as an integral and dependent part of a larger, interconnected system (सह-अस्तित्व).\n\nAn awakened human being, on the other hand, lives with the understanding of Prosperity (समृद्धि)—the feeling of having enough. They recognize their essential physical needs and live in a relationship of mutual fulfillment with nature, focusing on its nourishment (पोषण), not exploitation. They understand that the health of the planet is inseparable from their own well-being.\n\nThe solution to climate change is not just green technology, but the widespread awakening of a consciousness that knows how to live in harmony."
