          – a Universal proposal for humankind – by A Nagraj <br />

          Madhyasth Darshan (Coexistential thought) propounds universal humane constitution, education & organizational systems.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify leading-relaxed page-content">
          ‘Madhyasth Darshan’ is free of mysticism/secrecy. It makes the actuality, reality and truth of the complete dimensions of a human being study-able & understandable. The expression of the power of realization, conveying of all-round resolution, and the art of living via the method of just-full behaviour, lawful occupation & perfect conduct is gain-able via Madhyasth Darshan. Along with this, it makes intellectual resolution, material prosperity, fearlessness (freedom from intrinsic human fears) and coexistence accessible via reasonable solutions, in a systematic manner.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify leading-relaxed page-content">
          According to ‘Madhyasth Darshan’, every unit (activity) in Existence is endowed towards progression whilst participating with the entirety. In the process of knowing, believing, recognizing and fulfilling this fact, Humans are in self-organization and participate with the entire organization.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-justify leading-relaxed page-content">
          The human is the seer of all the <em>bhaavas</em> or essence in Existence. The understanding of all the essences itself is awakening in the conscious self or <em>jeevan</em> which is in the form of evidencing in realization and resolution in thought. The meaning of all round resolution is the recognition of human and ecological relationships (matter, plants, animals) and the fulfillment of the values intrinsic in them.
