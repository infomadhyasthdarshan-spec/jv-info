                        Numerous speculations have been offered regarding consciousness. For instance,
                        materialists have tried to explain the aspect of consciousness within the limits of
                        chemical processes. According to them, all functions are performed by the brain
                        (Medhas), or the brain carries out conscious activities, or the brain itself is
                        consciousness. In this context, Madhyasth Darshan presents an unprecedented
                        proposition that is universally inspiring. Madhyasth Darshan has described
                        consciousness as an <strong>action (kriya).</strong> This is also the intention of the materialists.
                        However, Madhyasth Darshan describes this action as an atom that has
                        achieved <strong>completion of formation (gathan purnata).</strong> This philosophy posits that
                        every atom is an atom by virtue of its formation. It is necessary for every
                        formation to have more than one constituent part (ansh). Explaining the meaning
                        of constituent and formation, it is said that it is that which manifests shape,
                        volume, and density. In the context of action, it is clarified that that which has
                        sensation and motion is action. This infinite group of actions is <strong>Nature (Prakriti)</strong>.
                        The entire Nature is submerged in <strong>Existence (Satta);</strong> consequently, it is saturated
                        in Existence. Explaining the root cause of this entire creation, the co-existence of
                        Nature and Existence has also been stated. Madhyasth Darshan claims that
                        Nature and Existence cannot be separated because there is no place devoid of
                        Existence. Consequently, the ceaseless activity of Nature is explained.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Madhyasth Darshan states that the constituent parts found in atoms do not have
                        independent motion. As evidence for this, it is said that a constituent part within
                        any formation cannot separate from the boundary of that formation until it is
                        disturbed by something else. After being disturbed, whether it is an atom or a
                        constituent part, it attains an unnatural motion. This unnatural motion has been
                        calculated by the name of <strong>power (shakti).</strong> These are the relative powers.
                        Continuing in this sequence, it is clarified that when an atom accommodates all
                        the constituent parts that it possibly can, that atom becomes free from chemical
                        reactions or the sequence of displacement-replacement events. For this reason,
                        its vibrational motion becomes greater than its circular motion, and at that very
                        moment, the manifestation of <strong>hope/expectation (asha)</strong> begins. This conscious
                        atom operates in a restrained manner in a space larger than its length, width, and
                        height, thus existing in a cluster form. Each cluster is the form of some living
                        being. That conscious atom, existing in a cluster form, operates the physical body
                        (jad sharir) according to its hope/expectation. It operates the physical body as
                        long as it remains a capable instrument, after which it separates from it. In this
                        way, the body, found within the limits of chemical processes, is obtained as an
                        instrument for the conscious unit and then dissolves. This is the process of birth
                        and death. The realm of chemical and physical results has been addressed
                        as <strong>material nature (jad prakriti).</strong> A clear process has been propounded for
                        material nature to evolve and attain the state of consciousness through the
                        completion of formation. Such conscious action, through change and refinement,
                        manifests its hope, thought, desire, and resolve through numerous living bodies
                        and, ancillary to that, through the human body, which is an objective truth.
                        Clarifying this objective truth, it has been stated that the fundamental tangible
                        form of a human being is hope, thought, desire, resolve, and realization, which
                        every human being sees within themselves. Madhyasth Darshan clarifies the solid
                        proof of conscious action being the operator of the physical body: whatever the
                        physical body takes in as food, drink, and air, the body assimilates what is
                        necessary and expels what is unnecessary, which is directly observable. What is
                        thus taken in is, in some quantity, power. In a ratio far exceeding that power,
                        powers are expelled. The greater amount that is expelled is entirely the power of
                        the conscious activity, which is hope, thought, desire, and resolve. As evidence of
                        this, it is seen that one generation provides various kinds of resources to the next
                        generation.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Every human being sees in their life that in all the chemical substances, physical
                        structure, and mechanical capacity of the body, there is not a single hope,
                        thought, desire, or resolve. At the same time, it is also seen that it is through such
                        a body that hope, etc., are manifested. Rational human beings do not have the
                        capacity to deny this objective truth. In this regard, Madhyasth Darshan clarifies
                        that the relationship between the medium and the effect becomes clear, like that
                        of electricity and machines. Without machines, it has not been possible to get an
                        introduction to relative powers. Continuing in this sequence, it is further clarified
                        that the physical body is the medium for conscious action. The manifestation in
                        any medium that is greater than its natural power will be of a different power.
                        Since the natural powers in the body are limited to the chemical and physical
                        realms, there is no possibility of hope, etc., manifesting in them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Madhyasth Darshan has clarified that <strong>hope, thought, desire, resolve, and
                        realization </strong>are the property of conscious action. When the material becomes
                        conscious, two fundamental achievements have been stated: (i) the completion of
                        formation, and (ii) the vibrational motion becoming greater than the circular
                        motion. The simultaneous occurrence of these two is the event of becoming
                        conscious. Both the conscious and the material have been described as action.
                        Madhyasth Darshan has claimed that <strong>decline (hraas)</strong> and<strong> development
                        (vikas) </strong>are found only within the limits of the atom, not in molecules or
                        structures. The revelation of this fact provides an angle for the thinking of
                        humankind. This clarifies the definite line between the material and the conscious.
                        The atom has been described as an atom by virtue of its formation. There is no
                        action without formation. Defining action, the combined state of sensation and
                        motion has been termed action. The possibility of the motion of constituent parts
                        has been stated, which are relative powers. Such motion has not been described
                        as its natural motion but as an <strong>agitated state/charge (aavesh).</strong> For this agitated
                        state, the attack and permeation of external forces are necessary. Madhyasth
                        Darshan has clarified the subtle knowledge concerning the atom and its
                        constituent parts. However, we see in every life that no agitated state is found in
                        anything without an external force. For example, until a stone is thrown, the
                        charge of acceleration is not found in it. In living beings, an agitated state is not
                        found without sensory influence. In the human body, an agitated state is not
                        found without thought.</p>
                    <p>From a single atom to the largest unit, it becomes clear that for a motion greater
                        than its natural motion, the imposition of external forces is necessary. However, in
                        the context of development, Madhyasth Darshan has propounded the
                        fundamental principle that the manifestation of power is a result of the unit's
                        motion. <strong>"Internal employment of such power = Development; external
                        discharge = Decline."</strong> How much this reflects an objective truth is seen in the fact
                        that the more we are engaged in external, dualistic processes like depending on
                        others, being a support for others, expectations, neglect, etc., the more tired we
                        become. In contrast, we see that we never get tired even when practicing living in
                        and for the self. The meaning of internal employment is to inspect oneself by
                        oneself and to follow oneself; this is alertness. In this context, Madhyasth Darshan
                        has clarified that the five activities found in conscious action are hope, thought,
                        desire, resolve, and realization. These five actions manifest respectively in
                        <strong>the Mind (Man), Disposition (Vritti), Psyche (Chitt), Intellect (Buddhi), and
                        Soul (Atma).</strong> A conscious atom is described as the combination of these five
                        activities. In the context of self-inspection in a conscious atom, it is said that the
                        Disposition (Vritti) inspects the Mind (Man), and the Mind is dedicated to the
                        Disposition, meaning it is ready to receive its signals. Similarly, the Psyche (Chitt)
                        inspects the Disposition, and the Disposition is dedicated to the Psyche; the
                        Intellect (Buddhi) inspects the Psyche, and the Psyche is dedicated to the Intellect;
                        the Soul (Atma) is the seer of the Intellect, and the Intellect is dedicated to the
                        Atma. This is complete development; as a result, a human being becomes
                        endowed with a mediated life. Explaining its necessity and utility, it is said that
                        such a human being is capable of manifesting and experiencing rules in
                        profession, justice in behavior, dharma in thought, and truth in experience. With
                        the revelation of this fact, the meaning of the internal employment of power in
                        human life becomes universally known and clear. This is the very conduct that
                        humanity has been deprived of for a long time. It is in the context of making this
                        universally accessible that the completion of formation, completion of action, and
                        completion of conduct have been clarified. The employment obtained through the
                        process of internal inspection has been described as the completion of conduct.
                        The completion of action has been described in a life of humanity. Madhyasth
                        Darshan has explained humanity in a comparative manner, or rather, the whole in
                        a comparative manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>Madhyasth Darshan has clarified the distinct study of 122 conducts manifesting in
                        a conscious unit replete with conduct, i.e., in a single conscious atom. This is an
                        unprecedented achievement for the world of thought. It paves a clear and
                        accessible path for every human being to attain the states of a <strong>humane-human,
                        a deity-human, and a divine-human.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Out of the 122 conducts, 2 of the Atma, 4 of the Intellect, 16 of the Psyche, 36 of
                        the Disposition, and 64 of the Mind have been clarified. This amazing revelation is
                        directly before all of humanity, that even physicists, through their research on the
                        atom and its parts, have accepted the possibility of 122 parts being
                        accommodated. From this, we get the clear knowledge that a formation-complete
                        atom contains 122 parts. Such an atom is free from chemical duality; this is the
                        proposition of Madhyasth Darshan. According to physicists, that atom is neutral
                        and inert. Madhyasth Darshan has clarified the completion of action for this atom
                        within the limits of humanity, and the completion of conduct within the limits of
                        divine humanity.</p>
                    <p>In the context of the formation of the atom, Madhyasth Darshan has stated that
                        every formation will have a central part; the constituent part located in that
                        central part has been indicated by the name <strong>Madhyansh (central constituent)</strong>.
                        This is proven meaningful only when one or more parts in one or more orbits
                        around the Madhyansh remain active in a circular path. It is a proposition of
                        Madhyasth Darshan that in a formation-complete atom, there will be four orbits
                        dependent on the Madhyansh; the conduct of the parts situated in these four
                        orbits is what manifests. Based on this, the 122 conducts of the parts contained in
                        the formation of atoms have been clarified. Madhyasth Darshan has indicated the
                        part located in the center of the atom by the name <strong>Soul (Atma)</strong> and has described
                        its action as <strong>mediated action (madhyasth kriya)</strong>. As evidence, it is said that it is
                        not affected by balanced-unbalanced influences. From this clear resolution, we
                        understand that the Atma remains unaffected by or detached from balancedunbalanced dualities. Further in Madhyasth Darshan, explaining the dignity of
                        mediated action, it is clarified that all dependent parts are compelled to develop
                        until they build the capacity, capability, and eligibility to receive the signals of the
                        Atma.
                    </p>
                    <p>Clarifying the relationship and position of the dependent parts, the parts found in
                        the first orbit of the Madhyansh are given the designation of <strong>Intellect (Buddhi)</strong>,
                        the parts found in the second orbit are called<strong> Psyche (Chitt)</strong>, the parts found in
                        the third orbit are called <strong>Disposition (Vritti)</strong>, and the parts found in the fourth
                        orbit are called<strong> Mind (Man)</strong>. This is a gift to the human race that clarifies the
                        ambiguous gap regarding the <strong>"self" (swa)</strong> and resolves the long-standing debates
                        and many doubts, which has been the eternal desire of humanity.</p>
