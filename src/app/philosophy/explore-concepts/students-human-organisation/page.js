        The Concept of Village based Organization – by A Nagraj
      </h1>

      <p className="italic text-center page-content mb-6">
        “The basis for an Undivided Society is Village Organization”
      </p>

      <p className="page-content text-center mb-10  ">
        – From the Original Hindi (परिवार मूलक ग्राम स्वराज्य व्यवस्था) by A Nagraj | English version by Shriram | Student | Jan 2017
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        The Family is the fundamental unit of the Village Organization. The family itself is a complete humane organization. Swarajya or self-rule means having the ease of access to Justice, Production & Exchange. The meaning of freedom or swatantrata is every human being self-organized and expressing, conveying and propagating the same. This takes place by knowing and assuming the Truth in the form of Existence, i.e. recognizing & fulfilling the mutually occurring relationships & values in Existence.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        “Every Human in Existence” is in organization with humanness and participates in the social organization. The obvious form of this is freedom in the form of self-organization and swarajaya or self-rule in the form of participation in the entire (larger) order. The participation of organization with the entirety is only possible with more than one person. Which is why the combined form of more than one person itself is nothing but family. It is only with perfect human conduct & behavior along with the availability of intellectual resolution and material prosperity in such a family that village self-rule or organization itself becomes easily possible which becomes the basis for an undivided society.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        Availability of justice-security in the family and in humanity means the recognition of human and ecological relationships and the fulfillment of values intrinsic in them. The form of self-sufficiency in human tradition is freedom (self-organization) in state and self-rule or organization in expression.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        Ease of access to means of production-work means making every member of the family independent in occupation by the time they become an adult, so that every adult in the family can get together and produce more than the material needs of the family. Production within the means of humanness means the production of ordinary expectations (food, clothing, shelter) and extraordinary expectations (radio, transport & television) by putting in physical efforts on the natural grandeur without causing it any harm – in a complementary manner. Material prosperity in the family does need more than this, nor is material prosperity possible in less than this.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        Ease of access to cooperative exchange-storage systems means the exchange of goods produced by the family with other families, on the basis of effort-value in a manner free of profit & loss (profit is defined as taking more and giving less in return), so every family can experience material prosperity. Profit centric business setups do not have any room in this system. Complete exchange systems means the exchange of investments of efforts of one family with other families on the basis of the effort-values (of the goods). The village shall have a storage facility, by means of which the excess production in every family shall be exchanged in external markets and the required goods from such external markets or villages shall be made available to the village inhabitants. This system shall be connected to the county, block, district, state and entire nation in a staged manner.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        It is only after village self-rule or organization is established and easily available, that it becomes possible for every human to participate in the entire existential organization and himself be occupied with humane organization. This itself is the witness of jeevans awakening for which human tradition has been desiring & waiting since time immemorial. Jeevans awakening itself propounds the meaning and usefulness of universal order in humans because evidence and resolution itself are expressions of universality in human tradition.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        Becoming proficient in universal sociability is wisdom, its conduct is authority and its protection and enrichment in continuity is sovereignty.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content italic">
        This itself is the aphorism or sutra for humane constitution. The final aim of village organization is the establishment of undivided sociability by which every human in society shall have access to intellectual resolution, material prosperity and ‘coexistence’ in a universal manner.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        Thus, the primary aim of this program is to realize and make others realize, the family centric village organization. Every member of every family in the village shall live with perfect humane conduct. Every human shall recognize and fulfill human & ecological relationships and their intrinsic values. They will obtain material prosperity – in others words, greater production than that is required. They shall express, convey & propagate intellectual resolution. To enable such capabilities itself is Village Organization.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content ">
        The basis of the ‘Village Organization Plan’ is the development of a production based utility-based perspective in the place of a job & business oriented mentality. This is our conception and commitment.
