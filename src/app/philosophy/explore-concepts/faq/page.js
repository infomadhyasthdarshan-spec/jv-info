                    <p className='page-content mb-4'>This has been propounded by Shri A.Nagraj of Amarkantak, MP, India (Originally from village Agrahara, Hassan, Karnataka). A.Nagraj lived until the age of 96 and passed away in March 2016.</p>
                    <p className='page-content mb-4'>This finding was the culmination of a rigorous practice of investigation that he undertook using Indian vedic methods, and finally, a self-improvised technique. Although the background for this proposal is in the Vedas, the Madhyasth Darshan proposal does not have any connection or interest in the vedas, or any other belief system or religion, etc. Read more about A Nagraj here. </p>

Madhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya) is not affiliated or limited to any class, caste, creed, religion, sect, gender, geography or time. It is not for a ‘select few’. It applies for all human beings – from children to adults, to those that are old. It is Universal, for entire humankind. It is based on Reality – and reality is the same for every person.</p>

                    <p className='page-content mb-4'>Reading is the first step to understanding. You can read the books, but this is not sufficient. It needs a human to explain it, since the meanings reside in the human, in the conscious aspect, the symbols for the words are in the books. Attending a 7 day introductory workshop is a good starting point. You can also visit the study locations or download some reading material here.</p>

You will need to first listen to this from a person, a human, for which you need to attend a workshop, or meet someone. </p>

As a result of understanding, the person starts recognizing harmony at all levels and responsibly participates in human-human systems and human-nature systems and thus produces evidence of happiness in oneself and becomes the source (inspiration) of happiness for others.</p>

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>Madhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism does not talk of “Do’s & Don’ts” and is not a ‘belief system’. It is not something to be ‘learned’ and ‘followed’ – but to be studied and ‘understood’. If we ‘understand’ reality, it naturally comes in our living. Jeevan Vidya is presented in the form of propositions, and does not expect anything to be accepted on faith but to thoroughly examine the truth or veracity of these propositions via self-investigation, in one’s own right.</p>
                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>Reality does not belong to anyone. Reality IS. Madhyasth Darshan – Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya ) is a proposal about reality.

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>The human is the seer, or the one who understands existence. Hence, any proposal regarding reality for humankind will have to come from the human-being himself. This can be seen from numerous examples in human history, including modern-science, where an individual first proposes, and everyone else then verifies it and it then comes into general acceptance.</p>

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>“Madhyasth Darshan -Coexistentialism (Jeevan Vidya)” is not an “organization” or a group. It is a knowledge system, a proposal on reality, that has been written in Literature form and whose meanings reside in humans that have understood it. . “It” does not ‘advertise’ or ‘evangelize’. All humans have a need to ‘know’, and living with such knowledge results in happiness. Thus, this is a proposal for all humans. Those who want to study it; can do so – free of cost, since knowledge cannot be sold, reality cannot be ‘sold’.  Everyone has the right to evaluate it, and accept or reject it after evaluation.</p>

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>No. It may seem like it, since the words used are similar, but madhyasth darshan proposes on reality ‘ground-up’ wherein the words used are from existing human language-traditions, but the definitions/meanings have been given totally anew. It so happens that spirit, spirituality, matter, material, conscious, consciousness, can all be known and are actually all inter-related, or ‘connected’.</p>

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>No. Although the origins of Madhyasth Darshan lie in Indian Vedic methods of investigation into reality, the entire proposal has been given “ground-up” based on A.Nagraj’s direct-experience or realization of reality as-it-is. Madhyasth Darshan does not refer to, quote, or promote any Eastern or Oriental thought, or ‘Western Philosophies’ for that matter.</p>

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>You will need to study this to really get that answer. Meanwhile, you can read the comparison in this article here.   While the words used are from existing human tradition, the definitions have been given totally anew. A lot of people have attempted to understand reality, and there has been success in many aspects.

                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>To draw an analogy from current day science: Just because the formula for a particular chemical compound seems complicated, does not mean we change it, since by changing it, the compound (chemical reality) will not be indicated anymore.</p>
                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>The primary purpose of language is to communicate meanings, reality between humans. Hence, if needed, language needs to change to accommodate or indicate reality so that on listening to such words, the human can understand the meanings of the words, understand the reality.</p>
                    <p className='page-content pb-4'>If we have the need to understand, we can do so – and then the words do not seem difficult. If you want to understand reality: yourself, existence and human purpose; have answers you will need to understand this as-it-is. Since, if we change the words, the meanings indicated will be lost, the reality obscured. And if that were to happen, what is the whole point?</p>
