            It is only in the non-delusion state that realization-knowledge and
            realistic-view (<em>darshan</em>) get completed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Awakening in deluded human-beings itself is functional-completeness
            and conduct-completeness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Functional-completeness is in the form of manifestation of all 10
            activities in ‘jeevan’.
          </li>
          <li>
            This happens via knowledge of realistic-view of Existence, knowledge
            of jeevan (self) and knowledge of complete-humane conduct. Awakening
            in ‘jeevan’ or the conscious-unit thus takes place by way of jeevan
            knowing its true form, properties, innate-nature, religion and the
            truth (coexistence = units saturated in space).
          </li>
          <li>
            This results in “intellectual resolution”, which results in
            continuity of happiness.
          </li>
          <li>
            The human living in human-consciousness lives with complete-humane
            conduct. This is as values, character and ethics. Values are in the
            form of 30 values, character is in the form of righteous-wealth,
            righteous marital (husband-wife) relationship and kindness in work &
            behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Human living in human-consciousness is able to live fulfilling the
            human-goal of resolution, prosperity, fearlessness (trust in the
            present) & coexistence and participate in orderliness from family to
            world-family leading to an undivided society and universal
            orderliness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only the human living in human-consciousness is able to live with
            his true innate-nature and knows and lives as evidence his
            ‘religion’ as resolution, happiness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Human living in human-consciousness is able to live with
            law-restraint-balance with the remaining 3 natural-orders and with
            justice-religion & truth with other humans.
          </li>
          <li>
            ‘Human’ (<em>manav</em>) living in human-consciousness is more
            evolved than the beastial-human living in animal-consciousness.
            ‘Human’ lives with the innate-nature of steadfastness, courage &
            generosity; subjects as: progeny, wealth and fame motives and
            primarily evidences the perspective of justice in living.
          </li>
          <li>
            ‘Godly-human’ (<em>dev-manav</em>) living in ‘godly-consciousness’
            is more evolved than the ‘human’ living with human-consciousness.
            Godly Human lives with innate-nature of steadfastness, courage &
            generosity plus kindness and graciousness; subject as fame motive
            and primarily evidences the perspective of religion (<em>dharma</em>
            ) – with justice in living.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divine Human (<em>Divya-manav</em>) with complete-awakening is more
            evolved than godly-human. Divine Human lives with innate-nature of
            steadfastness, courage & generosity plus kindness, graciousness &
            compassion; no motives left, lives only for beneficence and
            primarily evidences the perspective of truth – with justice &
            religion (<em>dharma</em>) in living.
          </li>
          <li>
            Man is a ‘replica’ of coexistence. He is the seer in coexistence.
            Existence spawned a unit that can understand Existence itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conduct-completeness is in the form of all the orbital-activities in
            the conscious-unit fully functioning under the influence of the
            centre unit (<em>atma</em>).

            Nature continuously manifests effort, motion, and constitution. As a
            result, nature itself is perceivable in four natural-orders.
          </li>
          <li>
            ‘Formation’ implies the changes in the constitution (form) of the
            atom, also manifested as properties (<em>guna</em>) which itself is
            visible as the different physical and chemical formations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Physical and chemical formations give rise to cells, which are
            manifested as vegetations and forests, insects, animal body and
            human body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deformation implies changes in the constitution (form) of the atom,
            also manifested as the ceasing of activity of respiration in plants,
            animal body and human body.
          </li>
          <li>
            ‘Jeevan’ or the conscious-unit does not ‘exist’ in plants and
            vegetations. Jeevan is only found in animals & humans. Jeevan
            leaving the animal-body or the human-body results in deterioration
            of the cells in the body and its death, which itself is deformation.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no ‘creation’ or ‘dissolution’ of ‘matter’ in existence.
            There is only formation and deformation.
