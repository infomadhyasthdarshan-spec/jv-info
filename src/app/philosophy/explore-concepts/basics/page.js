          Everything that exists is called ‘Existence’. Today, we have come to
          assume that things are in random arrangement, that the Universe is in

          <h1 className="page-small-hading">Existence (reality) is Coexistence</h1>

          <p className="page-content">
            Existence, is just not just the ‘material’ things we ‘see’ around us
            (like rocks, plants, etc) , but also consists of ‘space’ and
            conscious units, called ‘jeevan‘. Thus, ‘Coexistence’, means the
            existence of material & conscious units in all pervasive ‘space’.
            There is a definite ‘progression’ in Existence: plants evolve from
            matter, and animals evolve from plants and so on. We can understand
            progression and the definite direction in existence from the
            following 5 lines:
          </p>
          <p className="page-common-hading">1. Existence is Coexistence:</p>
          <p className="page-content">
            The nature of existence is not just physio-chemical, but all
            physical, chemical, and conscious (jeevan) entities are inseparably
            present in the all-pervasive ‘space’ or ‘void’.
          </p>

          <p className="page-common-hading">2. There is evolution in Existence:</p>
          <p className="page-content">
            There is evolution or ‘development progression’ in Existence: The
            formation of atoms, many species of atoms, molecules, larger
            formations are naturally occurring. The evolution of living life,
            plant life from matter, and its thousands of species and their
            propagation is also on its own. The atom is the basic unit in
            existence, in which development takes place. The atom has a
            madhyasth or mediating force/power that is in the central part
            (nucleus). This nucleus or central part of the atom or madhyasth
            force/power is responsible for regulating the other particles in the
            atom and maintaining its structure/constitution
          </p>

          <p className="page-common-hading">
            3. There is ‘development’ in Existence:
          </p>
          <p className="page-content">
            The progressive development in the atom yields an atom in which
            there can be no longer be any change in structure or constitution.
            This is called constitutional-completion or ‘गठनपूर्णता’. This
            singular atom becomes free of the bondage of molecular-association
            and weight – it is weightless. This atom is indestructible, hence
            ‘immortal’. This atom is the conscious Self (I). It has its own
            volition, with the ‘will to live’. We see in animals – they have the
            will to live, whereas, plants only live. We see the evolution of
            many species of animals – on land, water and in the air. Each animal
            is able to propagate its own species.
            <br />
            The Animal consists of the conscious self or jeevan in coexistence
            with the material body.
            <br />
            The Human being consists of the conscious self jeevan in coexistence
            with the material body. The conscious self or ‘I’ given the name
            jeevan is a constitutionally complete atom.
            <br />
            The human being has no role to play in any of this. All this is
            happening by itself.

            4. There is Awakening Progression in Existence:
          </p>
          <p className="page-content">
            Humans appear on the scene, with a more evolved body than animals.
            We not only have the will to live as in animals, but the will to
            live with happiness. In our quest for happiness, we have learnt to
            deal with and modify our surroundings. We have explored the material
            world & fulfilled our material needs via food-clothing-shelter &
            transport-radio-television.
            <br />
            We are now learning to live with other humans, live with nature. We
            are trying to find out our purpose on this planet. We are in a quest
            for knowledge, and satisfaction. Everything we do is for happiness.
            <br />
            To be ‘conscious’ means to have the ‘will to live’. In humans, this
            means having the ability to think, have imagination, feelings, etc.
            This is what distinguishes us from animals. As conscious beings, we
            wonder about the things around us, and are in the process of
            understanding who and what we are, why we exist, and how to live

            Reasons for the current human situation

          <p className="page-content">
            Our current ‘way’ or ability to see or perceive the world, reality,
            is limited to the dimensions of ‘form’ and ‘properties’. In other
            words, we can study & understand how things look and how they
            behave. All our study and understanding of the material world,
            including humans is currently only limited to these two dimensions.
            While this is useful, this is insufficient, as is evidenced by the
            complex problems we continue to face as a species.

            5. There is ‘Awakening’ in Existence: the solution
          </p>
          <p className="page-content">
            We are unable to see or apprehend the remaining two dimensions of
            reality of ‘innate nature’ (svabhav) & ‘beingness/religion’
            (religion). In other words, we are yet unable to understand the
            purpose of things and how they fundamentally are. The reason for
            this is because we only use/access partial (4.5) faculties in the
            conscious self, due to which our understanding and living is limited
            and delusional – we have a purely mechanistic or physical view of
            things, including ourselves. On accessing the remaining (5.5)
            faculties in the ‘conscious self’, we are able to ‘see’ all four
            dimensions of reality: form, properties, innate-nature &
            beingness/religion that correspond respectively to appearance,
            behavior, purpose and fundamental-nature of various realities such
            as stones, plants, animals and humans. This gives us holistic
            knowledge that satisfies us spiritually, intellectually &
            emotionally – which itself is happiness. When all 10 activities in
            the conscious self are functional, it is called
            ‘activity-completeness’ or क्रियापूर्णता and when all 10 are
            expressed in living with perfection, the state is called
            ‘conduct-completeness’ or आचरणपूर्णता .All these changes take place
            in the conscious self, the jeevan.

          <p className="page-content mb-4">On having this knowledge, we become fulfilled. When we express this understanding, live it, it manifests as synergy or harmony all around us. We can see this harmony at the following levels:</p>
          <h1 className="page-common-hading mb-4">1. Harmony in Ourselves</h1>
          <p className="page-content mb-4">Knowledge or understanding fulfills us spiritually,  intellectually & emotionally. All our questions are unanswered. We know our place and purpose. We understand & accept ‘intellectual laws’ of living. This is called ‘intellectual resolution’.</p>
          <h1 className="page-common-hading mb-4">2. Harmony in Human Family</h1>
          <p className="page-content mb-4">We are able to recognize our relationships in family, the purpose of the family and fulfill it at all times. These relationships are in the form of a parent, children, brothers, sisters, friends, our teachers, etc. We live in the expanse of these relationships and are able to have, express and fulfill emotions like trust, respect, affection, care, guidance, worship, gratitude & love.</p>
          <p className="page-content mb-4">The physical efforts we put in enable the family to have ‘material prosperity’</p>
          <h1 className="page-common-hading mb-4">3. Harmony in Society</h1>
          <p className="page-content mb-4">Society consists of many, many human families, living together for a common humane goal. By living in Harmony in the family, we automatically become harmonious in society. We are able to recognize and fulfill our relationship with other humans other than our own family. This is in the form of understanding & accepting universal ‘social law’. We recognize our responsibilities in Society & fulfill them.</p>
          <h1 className="page-common-hading mb-4">4. Harmony with Nature</h1>
          <p className="page-content mb-4">Nature is already in a state of harmony & balance.  Although it may seem that there are inconsistencies, or struggle, or competition in nature, this is not so. The struggle is in us, the viewer, that is observing nature. Only the human is not in harmony in the natural system. On understanding Coexistence, we understand & accept the universal ‘natural laws’ of living, which results in fulfilling our relationship with nature in a harmonious manner.</p>

    <h2 className="page-small-heading mb-4" id="14">One Human Race, One Human Religion</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        On having this knowledge, we understand and recognize that every humans wants to be happy,
        and can be so by having knowledge of coexistence.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        When we study the human body, we recognize that although we may seem to be from different races,
        are of different heights and shapes, of various colors, gender, languages, etc, our body composition
        is the same. Everyone has a heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, brain, etc. Our anatomies are basically the same.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        Whereas, we can see that in animals, the constitution of the body varies from one species to the other.
        Hence, we can understand that:
      </p>

      <h3 className="page-small-heading mt-6">Human Religion is One = Happiness.</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        – based on understanding in the conscious self – resolution = happiness. The word ‘Religion’ means to be
        <strong> ‘bound by’. We are bound by our need for happiness, by our need for knowledge.</strong>
        Our Religion is Happiness.
      </p>

      <h3 className="page-small-heading mt-6">Human Race is one</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        – based on the similar anatomy of the human body.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        The differences we see around us today are based on wrong assumptions – assumed religions based on belief
        and discrimination based on class, caste, gender, language, color, etc – which are nothing but illusionary.
        Having knowledge, we become free of such illusions &amp; delusions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="page-small-heading mt-10 mb-4 " id="15">Undivided Human Society, Universal Order</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        The society we see today is fragmented on many lines. There are numerous basis based on which we discriminate
        one human from the other. This has lead us to be in a perpetual state of some form of conflict or the other,
        of war. <strong>The discrimination and faulty beliefs</strong> that people behold towards each other itself is
        the cause of terrorism.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        The governance systems we are witness to today are based on the centralization of some form of ‘force’ or the
        other. Be it dictatorship, or feudal systems, or communist, socialist setups, or even democracy, all of them
        rely on <strong>the use of force and authority to varying degrees</strong>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        Whereas, on having knowledge of coexistence we realize and accept the equality between all humans and our
        relationship with every aspect of Existence, including humans. Being in harmony with humans is Naturally
        Acceptable to us. When we express this relationship in family and when every family is able to express this
        feeling, we have an <strong>Undivided Human Society</strong>.

  <h2 className=" mb-4 page-small-heading">Five Dimensional Human Program</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        Human Organization is needed in order to establish, sustain and further human endeavors that are in line with the Human Goal of having an awakened Society. An awakened human society fulfills the Human aim of Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction & Bliss.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        There are thus two kinds of programs for us:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 page-content">
        <li>A Program to ensure understanding or Knowledge in the conscious Self – leading to Resolution</li>
        <li>A program to ensure requirements of the Body – leading to Prosperity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        Put together, these fulfill the Universal Human Goal of
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 page-content">
        <li><strong>Intellectual Resolution</strong> in every Human</li>
        <li><strong>Material Prosperity</strong> in every Family</li>
        <li><strong>Fearlessness</strong> in Society – leading to an Undivided Society</li>
        <li><strong>Coexistence</strong> with Nature – leading to Universal Order</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        The program to fulfill the above Goals are in the following 5 dimensions, for which a committee needs to be formed in every village. Every family is assumed to consist of 10 members and a family shall spare one member to participate in the village organization. Every village shall consist of 100 such families, and will thus have a 10 member “village organization council”. This council shall then form 5 committees to address the following five dimensions:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6 page-content">
        <li>Education & right values or <em>sanskar Committee</em></li>
        <li>Health & Discipline <em>Committee</em></li>
        <li>Production & Work <em>Committee</em></li>
        <li>Exchange & Storage <em>Committee</em></li>
        <li>Justice & Security <em>Committee</em></li>
      </ol>

      <h3 className="mb-3 page-small-heading">10-staged Family based World Organization</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        These 5 dimensions of the Human Program can be carried out in 10 stages: starting from a single family at the first stage, to the entire world at the 10th stage. Each family elects a representative for coordinating with at the societal level, and 10 such members then go onto form a committee connecting to the next village or town.
