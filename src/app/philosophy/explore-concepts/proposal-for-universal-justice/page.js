        Proposal for Universal Justice
      </h1>

      <h2 className="page-heading ">
        An ‘Alternative’ Proposal for ‘Justice’ and ‘Universal Human Constitution’
      </h2>
      <p className="italic page-content">– on the basis of Madhyasth Darshan (Coexistentialism)</p>

      <p className="page-content">
        “Every human child expects justice since birth, desires for right behavior and work and speaks the truth”
        (A. Nagraj, proponent: Madhyasth Darshan).{' '}
        <strong>‘Realistic-view of Mediation’ or ‘Coexistentialism’.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        The child does not know the above realities (Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth). He depends on human tradition in order to understand these. Beliefs by name of Justice, Right behavior-work & Truth are commonly accepted by various communities. Accepting such beliefs, or the combination thereof, we grow up to be adult citizens, continuing to expect fulfillment of Justice in human relationships.
      </p>

      <h3 className="page-heading">What then really is Justice?</h3>
      <p className="page-content">
        Is there a form of Justice, a definition of Justice that is Universal? If there is, it will satisfy the following criteria:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 page-content">
        <li>Recognize each human as a unit of an Undivided Human Society (irrespective of Color, Creed, Caste, Geography, Language, etc).</li>
        <li>Recognize the nature of Human Relationships and their purpose.</li>
        <li>Have the ability to live with human values such as Trust, Respect, Affection, Love, etc., and be mutually satisfied in human relationships.</li>
        <li>Ensure the nourishment, protection and enrichment of Human-ness (Humanity).</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="page-content">This is Justice. To understand and ensure the above, it becomes essential to understand the:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside page-content space-y-2">
        <li>very nature of the Human Being,</li>
        <li>the basis of Human Relationship, including its underlying existential reality, and</li>
        <li>the nature of Existence itself (<em>“Existence – all that exists”</em>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="page-content">
        It is only on having universally verifiable answers to the above can a Universal, satisfying notion of Justice even be possible. While we have been able to arrive at a common understanding of stones, plants and animals, a universal, common understanding of the human is still awaited.
      </p>

      <p className="page-content">
        This has now become possible via Madhyasth Darshan (existence-based human focused contemplation), or ‘Coexistentialism’; a new development in human understanding by A. Nagraj of Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. It is not based on past ideologies or beliefs. He had realization of entire existence and found answers to questions related to the Human Being and Existence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="page-heading">Some fundamental tenets:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc page-content list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Existence itself is <strong>coexistence</strong>, as units saturated in all-pervasive Space; orderliness and Harmony is innate to Existence.</li>
        <li>Existence is <strong>Stable</strong> – Awakening and Progress are Definite.</li>
        <li>Nature is manifested as the four “natural-orders”: material, plants, animals & humans – that are self-organized and participate in larger orderliness.</li>
        <li>The Human alone creates problems due to his ignorance and delusion, as a result of living in an undeveloped state of consciousness called ‘animal consciousness’.</li>
        <li>The Human too wants to be in this Orderliness and can do so by having ‘Knowledge’ and living in ‘developed Human-consciousness’.</li>
        <li>The Material Order inherits behavior from atoms, Plant from seeds, Animal from race; Human from values or mentality (either beliefs or knowledge).</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote className="page-content italic">
        For example: An underlying assumption/view that ‘Existence/Nature is in struggle or chaos’ will only yield living which is conflict-centric. It is not possible to have Justice (mutual fulfillment in human relationship) as long as such a view prevails. On the other hand, if this view/mentality are aligned to Existential Truths – of there being inherent Harmony/Coexistence and Universal Orderliness, he will bring this to living form.
      </blockquote>

      <h3 className="page-heading">Based on the above facts, the following convictions can be realized:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc page-content list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Earth is One (Undivided Nation)</strong> – Nation States are man-made</li>
        <li><strong>Human Race is One</strong> – based on the formation of the Body – Human actions are many</li>
        <li><strong>Human Society is One</strong> – Communities are Many</li>
        <li><strong>Human Aim/Purpose is One</strong> (every human desires to be happy, and live in Orderliness) – the ways to fulfill this are many</li>
        <li><strong>Human Capabilities are the same</strong> – their manifestations are many</li>
        <li><strong>Universal Justice is One</strong> – Beliefs about the same are many</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="page-content italic mt-4">
        * Justice – the recognition of Human Relationships, fulfillment of values (Trust, Respect, Affection…), Evaluation and Mutual Satisfaction of both Individuals
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        This proposal (<strong>Madhyasth Darshan</strong> or{" "}
        <strong>Coexistentialism</strong>) dispels all mysteriousness by
        providing answers to human questions regarding the nature of Reality &
        Existence, the nature of the Human-being & Existential purpose of the
        Human being. It identifies and defines:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 page-content">
        <li>Universal Humane Conduct</li>
        <li>Universal Human Values</li>
        <li>Universal Human Religion</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-2 page-content">It proposes:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 page-content">
        <li>Universal Knowledge, Wisdom & Science</li>
        <li>
          Universal Education, Universal Human-conduct, Universal Human
          Constitution & Systems
        </li>
        <li>Human Culture, Civility & Norms of living</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        This leads to an{" "}
        <strong>Undivided Human Society and Universal Orderliness</strong>,
        wherein humankind can live in balance with the rest of nature.{" "}
        <strong>
          These answers are not imaginative and idealistic, but an outcome of
          direct-realization & understanding of Reality, as-it-Is.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        The method for transmission of such understanding or knowledge from one
        human to the other has been obtained, tested and proven. A number of
        initiatives are currently underway in various State Education
        Departments and Universities in India to bring this understanding into
        living.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2 page-content">This entire understanding has been written in 12 books in three sets, as:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 page-content mb-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Darśana</strong> or 'realistic-view': Existential postulations from realization
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vaada</strong> or 'ism': Expansion at the level of thought
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shastra</strong> or code of conduct/discipline in living
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Samvidhaan</strong> or Universal Humane Constitution – from essence to detail: in the form of human code of ethics
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        This <strong>'Alternative Proposal'</strong> has manifested itself in
        front of humankind via an individual in an existentially natural way.
        Until individualistic and communal-mentality prevail,
        excess-consumption, conflict and wars will remain, and global peace is
        not possible. If man desires to continue living on this planet, it is
        imperative to become free of criminal-mentality and delusion, so that
        the earth may regain its lost balance. The desirable outcomes of our
        progress to date have been in the areas of food-shelter-decoration, &
        radio television and transport. We are yet to have{" "}
        <em>
          “justice” in human-relationships, “orderliness/resolution” as human
          religion & know the ‘truth’.
        </em>{" "}
        Adopting this ‘Alternative’ seems to be the only way out.
