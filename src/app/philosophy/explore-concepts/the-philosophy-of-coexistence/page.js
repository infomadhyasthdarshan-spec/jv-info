        The Philosophy of Coexistence
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        Coexistence is the underlying law of the universe. It is the very basis
        of existential reality. It is the highest principle encompassing each
        and every element; we can say it’s the essence of the universe.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        ‘Nothing’ is alone, or ever will be. Indeed, Existence needs a ‘seer’
        and the ‘seen’. So there is at least this coexistence. 2 or more
        particles come together and form an atom. An atom is in intrinsic order.
        It is a coexistence of sub-atomic particles. Indeed, were these
        particles not to come ‘together’, no recognizable matter would exist,
        since nothing perceptible would form! I.e., we would have been in a vast
        emptiness with no planets at all!
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        On this planet, we see that every state is an expression of harmonious
        Coexistence. Nature, with its deep inter-linkages and its astounding
        order, the incredible symmetry in a snowflake for instance, the
        spellbinding complexity and spontaneous order in the human body for
        example, are all live examples of coexistence.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        We humans want to be in coexistence. Indeed, our bodies themselves are a
        coexistence of many individual organs that all function together in a
        beautiful symphony.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4  page-content">Have we humans created any of this?</p>
      <p className="mb-4 page-content">No.</p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">All this is occurring spontaneously, in coexistence.</p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        As humans, we seek each other's company. We seek each other’s comfort.
        We seek refuge in one another.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        Be it as families or as communities we feel comfortable in each other’s
        company. Indeed, we humans need another even to argue. For, if there was
        not more than one of us, who would we live with? Who would we be
        bothered about?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content ">This means we are linked. Inextricably.</p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        We would like harmony in such human relationships. Not having harmony,
        or having conflict bothers us.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        We want these relationships within the Family. We want these harmonious
        relationships between families. Indeed, we would like to have harmonious
        coexistence between every human family. Such families put together
        themselves form a harmonious society.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        However, even though we humans deeply desire such Coexistence, we are
        not able to see or appreciate this in daily life. We end up fighting
        within the family, amongst families, between communities, and across
        nation-states.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content font-semibold">
        Verily, we are somehow unable to translate our very innate intent for
        Coexistence into living.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 page-content">
        This is because as humans we live in underdeveloped consciousness.
      </p>

      <h2 className="page-small-heading mb-4">Coexistential Philosophy</h2>

      <p className="mb-4 page-content">
        The Philosophy of Coexistence is a paradigm-breaking discovery by Shri
        A.Nagraj of India. It posits that Coexistence is the innate nature of
        Existence, or Reality.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-outside space-y-2 mb-6 pl-5 page-content">
        <li>
          Order and Organization are intrinsic to nature. Indeed, as humans we
          are only able to study and comprehend orderly states. When we have a
          state of order within, we experience states such as happiness, peace,
          contentment and bliss.
        </li>
        <li>
          The universe is the coexistence of all-pervasive energy and matter and
          this coexistence is inseparable, indestructible, and imperishable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Human Life is also the coexistence of the sentient, incorporeal &
          imperishable jeevan-atom and the material, insentient body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Human beings have the most advanced physical body with a fully evolved
          cortex and faculty of imagination which is absent in other creatures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inherently the human race is one, the problem among human beings is
          their imagination, add to it the incorrect education and knowledge
          handed down by culture and society.
        </li>
        <li>
          Human beings innately desire love and affection with other human
          beings and to lead a life without conflict or that creates pain or
          suffering for other human beings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social norms and culture to date have not been able to create a social
          structure or establishment which is conducive to practising this humane
          way of life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Man believes in Perceived reality over actual reality due to the
          incorrect education and knowledge handed down by culture and society.
        </li>
        <li>
          The world can be aligned to the actual reality of inherent harmony &
          Coexistence via a systematic change in education and societal
          practices.
