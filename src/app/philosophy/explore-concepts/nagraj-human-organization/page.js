      <h2 className="page-small-heading  text-left">Five Dimensional Human Program</h2>

      <p className='page-content pb-10'>
        An Organization of the Human World is needed in order to establish, sustain and further human endeavors that are in line with the Human Goal of having an awakened Society. An awakened human society fulfills the Human aim of Happiness, Peace, Satisfaction & Bliss.
      </p>

      <b className='page-content'>There are thus two kinds of programs for us:</b>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 page-content">
        <li>A Program to ensure understanding or Knowledge in the conscious Self – leading to Resolution</li>
        <li>A program to ensure requirements of the Body – leading to Prosperity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className='page-content'>Put together, these fulfill the Universal Human Goal of</p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 page-content">
        <li>Intellectual Resolution in every Human</li>
        <li>Material Prosperity in every Family</li>
        <li>Fearlessness in Society – leading to an Undivided Society</li>
        <li>Coexistence with Nature – leading to Universal Order</li>
      </ul>

      <p className='page-content'>
        The program to fulfill the above Goals are in the following 5 dimensions, for which a committee needs to be formed in every village. Every family is assumed to consist of 10 members and a family shall spare one member to participate in the village organization. Every village shall consist of 100 such families, and will thus have a 10 member “village organization council”. This council shall then form 5 committees to address the following five dimensions:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 page-content">
        <li>Education & right values or sanskar Committee</li>
        <li>Health & Discipline Committee</li>
        <li>Production & Work Committee</li>
        <li>Exchange & Storage Committee</li>
        <li>Justice & Security Committee</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-lg page-heading pt-10">A brief elaboration is provided below:</h3>

      <h4 className="page-small-heading ">1. Education & right values or sanskar Committee</h4>
      <p className='page-content'>
        This is the primary program for Humans. The human is a combined form of the conscious self or jeevan and the physical-chemical body. The basic need of the conscious jeevan is knowledge or understanding, by which it becomes fulfilled: has happiness, peace, satisfaction, etc. The primary purpose of Education is to thus enable this need.
      </p>
      <p className='page-content'>
        This is called Humane Education and is possible via Consciousness Development via Human Values (CVMS). Our entire education will have to be re-established in this light. Our way of looking at ourselves, at reality, and our program has to be re-looked at. This committee shall look into these aspects:
      </p>
      <p className='page-content'>
        This is in contrast to current day Education where the aims vary from place to place, from country to country. There have been two kinds of Education in human history to date:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 page-content">
        <li>Religious Education, which seeked to further Religious aims and dictats</li>
        <li>Materialist Education: which seeks to establish a proven understanding of Material Reality and the ability to acquire it in later life</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='page-content'>
        ‘Coexistentialist Education’ means to understand all aspects of Existence, Human Being, and Human Living on this basis.
      </p>

      <h4 className="page-small-heading">2. Health & Discipline Committee</h4>
      <p className="page-content">
        The Body is needed for the conscious jeevan to acquire knowledge and also express this understanding in Human Living: in family, society, etc. Humans did not make the human body. We did not make ourselves. We have come to be. The human body is a fine balance of many many vital organs that work together to function as a synergistic whole. All the organs work together in a fine rhythm so the 5 senses (sight, touch, sound, smell & taste) and 5 motor organs (hands, feet, urination, excretion & swallowing) function smoothly.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        The role of discipline is to understand what is suitable for the Human Body and ensure this. It is the responsibility of conscious jeevan to do this. Health is a result of this discipline and nutrition & exercise. To be healthy means the 5 sense organs and 5 motor organs are functioning as per the needs of jeevan. This committee shall look into these aspects.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        Today, we see that we try and get satisfaction from the Body. Since our need for happiness is continuous, the things we do with the body, on the body in order to derive sensory pleasure is also seemingly endless, due to which the Body becomes abused. Hence, it is only with discipline that Health can be ensured.
      </p>

      <h4 className="page-small-heading">3. Production & Work Committee</h4>
      <p className="page-content">
        The Body needs material input. Human endeavor needs material input. The efforts we apply on the rest of nature to get material things is called Work. Production is a result of work. On understanding Coexistence, work follows the approach below:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 page-content">
        <li>We produce as much as is needed to fulfill and exceed the material requirements of the Family. Since the need of the Body is limited, production is also definable and becomes limited.</li>
        <li>The method of production follows the inherent laws of cyclicity in Nature – human production thus not only sustains Nature, but can also enrich it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="page-content">
        This in contrast to our current approach where production is unlimited, even behaving with people is considered work, and most of our reliance on energy and production techniques, not to mention consumption patterns are steadily eroding Nature.
      </p>

      <h4 className="page-small-heading">4. Exchange & Storage Committee</h4>
      <p className="page-content">
        Not everyone produces everything. We don’t produce all year round. We thus store the excess production for future use and Exchange the excess with others for goods that we may need in return. We are able to do this with the right understanding. This means we have understood Justice, Religion & Truth. The perspectives of Liking, Health & Profit become restrained under the influence of such understanding. We are thus able to partake in profit-less Exchange and do not engage in hoarding out of fear, greed, etc.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        Our exchange mechanisms today are profit-centric. They assume that profit will lead to goods, which shall lead to happiness. They also assume that a few people profiting will benefit the larger society. The problem with this is there is no end-point of satisfaction when it comes to profit, since there will always be a mathematical number in profit that will be greater than what we have. This leads to hoarding of wealth. This whole notion needs to be re-looked at, since it is not serving human purpose.
      </p>

      <h4 className="page-small-heading">5. Justice & Security Committee</h4>
      <p className="page-content">
        Justice means the code of conduct to ensure the protection of humanness. Justice can only be understood on understanding human relationship, which itself can only be understood on understanding the human being and the nature of reality that connects two humans. The satisfaction point of human relationship itself is Justice. This is achieved by recognizing relationships as they are a part of Human Order, fulfillment of the values and mutual fulfillment of both humans involved.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        When we rightly-utilize a thing, it automatically becomes secured. In this way, we are able to ensure the security of mind, body and wealth by right-utilization.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        Today, we pass judgements in the name of justice. We talk of justice only in response to a wrong that has been done. We don’t understand what Justice is, in itself. Retribution and punishment depends on fear as a deterrent. It doesn’t teach right understanding. As a result, our crimes never seem to stop. Such use of force and power itself gives rise to struggles and uprising, which causes a Security problem.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        Individuals, societies and Nations, in their endless quest for power, influence and wealth routinely transgress onto others’ boundaries, further exacerbating the problem. The basic reason for this is that the continuous needs of the conscious jeevan cannot be fulfilled by the finite material world. The faculties in the jeevan are inexhaustible. They can only be fulfilled by knowledge. If we understand this, our problems in Justice and Security sort themselves out.
      </p>

      <h3 className="page-small-heading">10-staged Family based World Organization</h3>
      <p className="page-content">
        These 5 dimensions of the Human Program can be carried out in 10 stages: starting from a single family at the first stage, to the entire world at the 10th stage. Each family elects a representative for coordinating with at the societal level, and 10 such members then go onto form a committee connecting to the next village or town.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        Thus, at the first (1st) level, around 10 people in a family (called “Family Organisation”) are engaged in activities related to resolution and prosperity meeting their partial needs through own production.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        At the second (2nd) level, 10 such families (called “Neighbour Family Organisation”) organised together and participating in 5 dimensional program are able to meet all basic requirement and some additional requirements of all 10 families. Each family with consent of all 10 members (called “Family Assembly”) spares a member for coordinating the activities of these 10 families in addition to carrying activities in family as agreed by all members of the family. These 10 members spared from 10 families make a “Neighbour Family Assembly”.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        The same sequence of each level electing 1 member, and 10 such members forming a committee of governance or order is then continued at the level of the Village, County, Block, District, Group of Districts, State, Nation and Inter-Nation, thus connecting all the way to the entire World in 10 stages.
      </p>
      <p className="page-content">
        Thus based on this understanding, we have the relationship from Family to World Family and systems for human functioning from Family Order to World Family Order.
