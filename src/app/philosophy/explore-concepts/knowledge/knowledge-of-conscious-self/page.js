It is’ material’ in the sense it is made up of matter’ and hence a ‘substance’. It has dimensions and occupies space (has volume) but its weight cannot be ‘measured’ (weightless), whereas physiochemical atoms have weight. The conscious unit’s (chaitanya ikai) span of function is more than its length, width, and height and it has an active thinking-aspect.  The physiochemical unit’s (jad ikai) span of function is limited to its length, width, and height and does not have any thinking-aspect.</p>
